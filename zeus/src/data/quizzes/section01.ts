    question: 'How many satoshis are in 1 Bitcoin?',
    correctAnswer: 100000000,
    numericRange: { min: 0, max: 1000000000, precision: 0 },
    difficulty: 'easy',
    explanation: '1 BTC = 100,000,000 satoshis (100 million). A satoshi is the smallest unit of Bitcoin, named after its creator.',

    question: 'What is a UTXO?',
    options: [
      'A type of cryptocurrency exchange',
      'A Lightning Network channel',
      'A Bitcoin mining pool',
      'An unspent transaction output that represents spendable bitcoin',
    ],
    correctIndex: 3,
    difficulty: 'medium',
    explanation: 'UTXO stands for Unspent Transaction Output. Bitcoin tracks individual chunks of bitcoin rather than account balances. Your wallet balance is the sum of all UTXOs you can spend.',

    type: 'multiple-choice',
    question: 'If you have a 50,000 sat UTXO and pay someone 30,000 sats, what happens?',
    options: [
      'Only 30,000 sats are deducted from your balance',
      'You need to find exact change from multiple UTXOs',
      'The entire UTXO is consumed and you get change back',
      'The transaction fails because UTXOs cannot be split',
    ],
    correctIndex: 2,
    difficulty: 'medium',
    explanation: 'When spending, the entire UTXO is consumed. A new UTXO is created for the recipient (30,000 sats) and another for your change (minus fees). Think of it like paying with a $50 bill.',

    question: 'What unit are on-chain transaction fees typically measured in?',
    correctAnswer: 'sat/vB',
    difficulty: 'hard',
    explanation: 'On-chain fees are measured in satoshis per virtual byte (sat/vB). The total fee = fee rate (sat/vB) × transaction size (vB).',

    type: 'multiple-choice',
    question: 'Can you derive a private key from a Bitcoin address?',
    options: [
      'No, the cryptographic function is one-way',
      'Yes, addresses and private keys are interchangeable',
      'Yes, but only with quantum computers',
      'No, but you can from the public key',
    ],
    correctIndex: 0,
    difficulty: 'easy',
    explanation: 'The relationship is one-way: Private Key → Public Key → Address. You cannot reverse this process, which is the cryptographic property that secures Bitcoin.',

      'Seed phrase',
      'Wallet password',
    ],
    correctIndex: 1,
    difficulty: 'easy',
    explanation: 'Bitcoin addresses are safe to share - they are designed to receive payments. Private keys, seed phrases, and passwords should never be shared as they control your funds.',
