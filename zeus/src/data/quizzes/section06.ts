    question: 'What is the main difference between a Lightning invoice and a Bitcoin address?',
    options: [
      'Lightning invoices are permanent, addresses expire',
      'Addresses are for larger amounts only',
      'Lightning invoices are typically single-use, addresses can be reused',
      'There is no difference',
    ],
    correctIndex: 2,
    difficulty: 'medium',
    explanation: 'Lightning invoices are typically single-use payment requests that expire after a set time. Bitcoin addresses can technically be reused (though not recommended for privacy).',

    question: 'What are routing fees?',
    options: [
      'Fees paid to Bitcoin miners',
      'Small fees charged by intermediate nodes that forward your payment',
      'Fees charged by Zeus',
      'Fees for opening channels',
    ],
    correctIndex: 1,
    difficulty: 'easy',
    explanation: 'Routing fees are small amounts charged by intermediate nodes that forward your Lightning payment. They typically consist of a base fee plus a percentage of the amount.',

    question: 'What is Keysend?',
    options: [
      'A way to send your private keys securely',
      'Spontaneous Lightning payments without an invoice',
      'A key management feature',
      'A type of channel backup',
    ],
    correctIndex: 1,
    difficulty: 'medium',
    explanation: 'Keysend allows spontaneous Lightning payments that only require the recipient\'s node public key - no invoice needed. Useful for tips and donations.',

    id: 4,
    type: 'multiple-choice',
    question: 'For small amounts, which payment method is usually more economical?',
    options: [
      'They cost the same',
      'It depends on the time of day',
      'On-chain Bitcoin',
      'Lightning Network',
    ],
    correctIndex: 3,
    difficulty: 'easy',
    explanation: 'Lightning is almost always more economical for small amounts because on-chain fees don\'t depend on the amount - a 100 sat transfer costs the same as a 1 BTC transfer.',

    question: 'What cryptographic proof does Zeus store to prove a Lightning payment was received?',
    correctAnswer: 'preimage',
    difficulty: 'hard',
    explanation: 'The payment preimage is proof that a Lightning payment was received. Zeus stores this automatically, and it can be used to prove payment in case of disputes.',

    question: 'What does BIP21 with Lightning enable?',
    options: [

      'Lower Lightning fees',
      'Multiple addresses in one invoice',
    ],
    correctIndex: 0,
    difficulty: 'medium',
    explanation: 'BIP21 with Lightning embeds a Lightning invoice inside a Bitcoin URI. Compatible wallets try Lightning first and fall back to on-chain if needed.',
