Suppose $p = m/n$ where $m$ and $n$ are integers with no common factors. Then $p^2 = m^2/n^2 = 2$, so $m^2 = 2n^2$.

This shows $m^2$ is even, hence $m$ is even (since the square of an odd number is odd).

Write $m = 2k$. Then $4k^2 = 2n^2$, so $n^2 = 2k^2$, showing $n$ is also even.

But this contradicts our assumption that $m$ and $n$ have no common factors. ∎

Choose any $x_0 \\in X$ and define $x_{n+1} = \\varphi(x_n)$.

$d(x_{n+1}, x_n) = d(\\varphi(x_n), \\varphi(x_{n-1})) \\leq c \\cdot d(x_n, x_{n-1}) \\leq c^n d(x_1, x_0)$.

For $m > n$: $d(x_m, x_n) \\leq \\sum_{k=n}^{m-1} d(x_{k+1}, x_k) \\leq d(x_1, x_0) \\sum_{k=n}^{\\infty} c^k = \\frac{c^n}{1-c} d(x_1, x_0)$.

So $\\{x_n\\}$ is Cauchy. By completeness, $x_n \\to x$ for some $x \\in X$.

Since $\\varphi$ is continuous: $\\varphi(x) = \\varphi(\\lim x_n) = \\lim \\varphi(x_n) = \\lim x_{n+1} = x$.

Uniqueness: If $\\varphi(x) = x$ and $\\varphi(y) = y$, then $d(x, y) = d(\\varphi(x), \\varphi(y)) \\leq c \\cdot d(x, y)$.

Since $c < 1$, this forces $d(x, y) = 0$. ∎
