    question: 'Russell\'s paradox considers the set $R = \\{x : x \\notin x\\}$. The paradox arises when we ask:',

      'Is $R$ empty?',
      'Is $R$ finite or infinite?',
      'Is $R \\in R$?',
      'Is $R$ a subset of itself?',

    correctIndex: 2,
    difficulty: 'medium',
    explanation: 'If $R \\in R$, then by definition $R \\notin R$. If $R \\notin R$, then by definition $R \\in R$. This contradiction shows naive set theory is inconsistent.',

    question: 'Russell\'s paradox demonstrates that:',
    options: [
      'Sets cannot contain other sets',
      'The empty set does not exist',
      'All sets must be finite',
      'Not every collection described by a property forms a set',
    ],

    difficulty: 'medium',
    explanation: 'The paradox shows that "the set of all sets not containing themselves" cannot exist. This means unrestricted comprehension (forming sets from any property) leads to contradictions.',

    question: 'In ZF set theory, which principle replaces the naive comprehension axiom to avoid Russell\'s paradox?',
    options: [
      'The axiom of extensionality',
      'The axiom of separation (or specification)',
      'The axiom of union',
      'The axiom of pairing',
    ],
    correctIndex: 1,
    difficulty: 'hard',
    explanation: 'The axiom of separation allows forming $\\{x \\in A : P(x)\\}$ only from an already-existing set $A$. You cannot form "the set of all $x$ such that $P(x)$" without a bounding set.',

    explanation: 'If a universal set $V$ existed, then $R = \\{x \\in V : x \\notin x\\}$ would be a legitimate set by separation, recreating Russell\'s paradox.',

    question: 'The barber paradox ("the barber shaves all those who do not shave themselves") is analogous to Russell\'s paradox. Who shaves the barber?',
    options: [
      'The scenario is self-contradictory; no such barber can exist',

    correctIndex: 0,
    difficulty: 'easy',
    explanation: 'Like Russell\'s paradox: if the barber shaves himself, he doesn\'t (since he only shaves those who don\'t shave themselves). If he doesn\'t, he must. The barber cannot exist.',
