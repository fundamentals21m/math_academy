1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,600
The most common solutions to basic human problems take time.

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:07,280
Many entail building new skills that require habits and structure,

3
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:09,519
and it's a long way towards mastery.

4
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:15,039
Understanding Bitcoin is no different, except it's far more demanding than most realize.

5
00:00:15,039 --> 00:00:18,879
This chapter explores why the time required to master Bitcoin

6
00:00:18,879 --> 00:00:22,239
creates a fundamental mismatch with institutional timelines.

7
00:00:22,239 --> 00:00:24,559
Imagine wanting to learn to play the guitar.

8
00:00:24,559 --> 00:00:28,320
It would take an ordinary person with a 40-hour-a-week job several years

9
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,800
just to be able to play something competent for a recital.

10
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:34,640
The first year of guitar involves learning to read music,

11
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:38,960
learning basic fingering techniques, learning how to hold a pick and strike the strings,

12
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:43,759
learning basic open chords, e, a, g, c, d.

13
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:49,039
Perhaps after a year, you're strumming these chords without muffled strings.

14
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:53,200
With significant time investment, you might successfully play a song.

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,640
A person holding down a demanding job would have to carve out two hours a day

16
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:02,000
just to do something minimally competent on the guitar at the end of the year.

17
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,959
This will have significant consequences.

18
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,680
You can't socialize with friends.

19
00:01:08,239 --> 00:01:10,400
You can't spend time with spouse and children.

20
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,959
You're sacrificing career prospects.

21
00:01:13,599 --> 00:01:14,480
It is what it is.

22
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:18,079
You're not going to play the guitar without putting in the time,

23
00:01:18,079 --> 00:01:19,519
and time is very costly.

24
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:24,879
It can't be faked, and it's a particularly gratifying win when it is realized for that reason.

25
00:01:24,879 --> 00:01:28,079
Since the launch of the Bitcoin Core Protocol in 2009,

26
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,640
more and more people have decided that it is important to understand this thing.

27
00:01:33,519 --> 00:01:38,319
It turns out that understanding Bitcoin is like learning to play multiple instruments at the same time.

28
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:44,079
Guitar, piano, drums, horns, and you've got to know how they all come together.

29
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,079
You also need to learn music theory, how to conduct an orchestra,

30
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:50,799
and understand why music exists in the first place.

31
00:01:51,519 --> 00:01:55,359
Learning Bitcoin requires having minimal competence in many disparate fields.

32
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,159
Austrian economics, understanding sound money and time preference,

33
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:04,079
computer science, how the protocol and network function,

34
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:08,319
history, monetary history, and why Bitcoin matters.

35
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:11,520
Mathematics, the cryptographic foundations,

36
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:16,000
game theory, network incentives, and Nash equilibrium.

37
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:20,159
Cryptography, public and private key infrastructure.

38
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:24,159
Deciding to master Bitcoin is accepting a lifetime of study,

39
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:27,599
as well as being likely faded to never completely understand it.

40
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:31,919
The type of person who takes on such a challenge is in quite a predicament.

41
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:35,039
It's one thing to tell your wife you'll be a badass rock star in a year or two.

42
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:39,520
But it's quite another to tell her that you're going to be a scholar that nobody appreciates,

43
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:42,240
and all of your wealth is going into magic internet money.

44
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:47,360
Would you expect anything less from somebody who would devote a large portion of their wealth

45
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,240
to this discovery?

46
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:51,520
Would you expect anything less than the pursuit of mastery?

47
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:56,960
Bitcoin will experience the types of ups and downs that all but a few seasoned investors

48
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:57,759
have the stomach for.

49
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,120
The commitment is not for the faint of heart.

50
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,439
Companies are not used to thinking of time in this way.

51
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:08,400
Yes, they have projects and project managers and governance structures to try to achieve

52
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:13,520
long-term and large ambitions. But these ambitions are ones that require and receive permission.

53
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:18,719
A company wishing to carry out a five-year project will likely first get permission from their

54
00:03:18,719 --> 00:03:23,599
board. This entails buying opinions from management consultants like McKinsey,

55
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:28,639
bankers like JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs, and auditors like EY and PWC.

56
00:03:29,439 --> 00:03:33,360
It requires severance packages to executives who fought the effort and lost,

57
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:36,400
and promoting new executives around the CEO who championed it.

58
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:42,080
It usually requires an existential problem to get all of the battleships aligned around a single

59
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:46,800
long-term objective. Here's the fundamental problem.

60
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:52,960
Outside of an existential desire, companies like Easy and Quick Solutions.

61
00:03:53,919 --> 00:04:00,960
They think in terms of quarters, not years, and not multiple years, the time frame from a person

62
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:05,759
seeing Bitcoin as a solution to a problem, and gaining the understanding of Bitcoin to have the

63
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:12,240
skill and conviction to successfully implement such a solution is multi-year and closer to a human

64
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:17,600
lifetime than a quarter. Companies which embark on this path will need to develop new optics to

65
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:22,079
determine the success of these efforts. Traditional quarterly metrics won't apply.

66
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:27,120
Most companies consist of employees who haven't spent more than an hour developing the competent

67
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:33,040
skills to feel any confidence implementing a Bitcoin strategy. Training current staff will

68
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:39,439
take years if they can be encouraged to learn. Companies can hire Bitcoin experts, but we're in the

69
00:04:39,439 --> 00:04:46,079
early days. Arguably, there aren't more than 5,000 people on Earth that have the mastery required

70
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:52,079
to successfully implement institutional Bitcoin strategies. There are no easy answers. Companies

71
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:58,240
need to accept that they won't contribute much to Bitcoin for quite a while. But starting today,

72
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,680
we'll get them there faster. Let's recap what we learned in this chapter.

73
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:07,120
Mastery takes time. Just as learning guitar requires years of dedicated practice,

74
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:12,560
understanding Bitcoin requires sustained commitment. Bitcoin requires multidisciplinary knowledge,

75
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:18,639
economics, computer science, history, mathematics, game theory, and cryptography.

76
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:25,360
Companies think in quarters, not years, but Bitcoin mastery is closer to a human lifetime than a quarter.

77
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:31,759
Bitcoin expertise is scarce. Arguably fewer than 5,000 people on Earth have the required mastery

78
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:37,759
for institutional implementation. The only advice? Start today. There are no easy answers,

79
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:43,199
but beginning the journey now will get institutions there faster than waiting. In the next episode,

80
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:52,879
we'll explore. Chapter 5 Bitcoin is a bearer asset. We'll examine why this extraordinary property

81
00:05:52,879 --> 00:06:00,480
makes Bitcoin fundamentally different from everything else. See you in the next one.
