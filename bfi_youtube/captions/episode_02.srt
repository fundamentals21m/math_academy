1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,480
The crux of the matter is the notion that holdling is an irrational and unreasonable act,

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:08,640
or at least requires a willful ability to be irrational or unreasonable.

3
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:11,919
It might seem odd to begin a book about institutional bitcoin,

4
00:00:11,919 --> 00:00:15,279
with a section titled, Bitcoin is for individuals.

5
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,960
But this foundation is critical to any organization that aspires to use bitcoin successfully.

6
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,640
Many have tried and few have succeeded.

7
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:29,440
The very short history of bitcoin has many examples of institutions that have either perished,

8
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:33,119
or brought themselves to the brink of destruction trying to offer consumer products.

9
00:00:33,759 --> 00:00:39,840
Their failures share common themes. First, products that didn't have the structural integrity

10
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:48,079
to withstand bitcoin's volatility. Second, products that didn't respect the constraints of bitcoin.

11
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:53,439
Third, products that went against the natural order of human action.

12
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:57,280
Consider the graveyard of bitcoin institutions.

13
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:03,439
Exchanges like meat gocks and FTX failed due to custody failures and fraud.

14
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:10,719
Yeild products like Celsius, BlockFi, and Anchor, collapsed from unsustainable yield promises.

15
00:01:11,599 --> 00:01:18,239
Altcoins like Terra, Luna, BSV, and B-Cache proved to be failed hard forks and Ponzi schemes.

16
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:22,480
Castodians like Prime Trust, failed to mismanagement of client assets.

17
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,400
All of these companies' failures took down large chunks of the industry,

18
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:29,200
and did a lot to slow the worldwide adoption of bitcoin.

19
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:34,560
The author realized how distinct a human act it was to hodl bitcoin, holding on for dear life.

20
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:39,680
When considering whether some artificial intelligence could ever buy, sell, or hodl it.

21
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:45,599
Even amongst humans, the vast majority of bitcoin that has ever been acquired has changed hands

22
00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:51,760
several times over. If humans have a hard time hanging onto their bitcoin, why would AI be any

23
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:58,879
different? Here's the core insight. Hodling requires a willful ability to be irrational or unreasonable.

24
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:03,439
This ability is difficult to model into software, and even more difficult to execute through

25
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:07,760
corporate or institutional governance, where reputations are built and destroyed at these crucial

26
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:13,599
points. Human action is based on an individual's unique set of circumstances at a given moment.

27
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:18,639
Specifically, the largest source of dissatisfaction that can be removed at the lowest cost.

28
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:24,960
This is the water diamond paradox. A person would forego all the diamonds in the world for their

29
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:30,879
first glass of water. At an institutional level, the decision to remove the largest source of

30
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:36,159
dissatisfaction stems from the human beings who have the power and their particular source of pain,

31
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:43,360
theoretically, and legally. Corporate governors are bound by a fiduciary duty to deliver profits

32
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:51,199
to shareholders. However, in practice, other incentives often prove more powerful. Consider job

33
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:57,120
security. Keeping their job is often a more powerful incentive than maximizing shareholder value.

34
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,639
External pressure from activist investors and political forces can override profit motives,

35
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:07,520
and short-term thinking driven by quarterly reporting cycles creates pressure to show immediate

36
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:14,319
results rather than long-term value creation. In 2020, two companies, MicroStrategy,

37
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:20,400
NowStrategy, and Tesla made the bold move to put Bitcoin on their balance sheet. Neither was in the

38
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:27,599
S&P 500. Both were extensions of an individual who believed in Bitcoin, Michael Sailor, and Elon Musk.

39
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:33,840
The outcomes were dramatically different. Strategy continued accumulating Bitcoin aggressively.

40
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:41,360
They now have a nearly $100 billion market capitalization. They await S&P 500 entry despite

41
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:46,800
meeting the criteria. They demonstrate long-term HODL commitment.

42
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:55,439
Tesla initially purchased Bitcoin for Treasury. They exited their position shortly after S&P 500

43
00:03:55,439 --> 00:04:01,280
inclusion. Their experience demonstrates institutional pressure to sell and shows the limits of

44
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:08,240
corporate Bitcoin holding. This contrast perfectly illustrates why institutional Bitcoin holdings

45
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:13,840
require a dominant individual to succeed. Many Bitcoiners are waiting for mega companies like Apple

46
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:19,120
or Facebook to put Bitcoin on their balance sheet. Some think governments will get into the game.

47
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:23,199
Others are waiting for pensions and endowments to commit asset allocation to Bitcoin.

48
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:29,199
They are all misguided. Even Bitcoin institutions like publicly traded mining companies

49
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:34,079
eventually succumb to the pressure of selling their Bitcoin. The structural incentives of

50
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:41,040
institutional governance work against long-term Bitcoin holding. El Salvador is the nation

51
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:46,000
with the most aggressive strategy to publicly accumulate and use Bitcoin.

52
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:51,680
President Bukile has a superior understanding of both Bitcoin and his country.

53
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:58,639
But even with all of this in place, we don't know what El Salvador will look like when Bukile is

54
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:04,399
no longer the president. Countries can have a longer time horizon than companies. However,

55
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:10,079
most nations are unable to develop a long horizon and end up endlessly borrowing from the IMF

56
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:15,839
and World Bank. Western democracies have generally short-time horizons as leaders are elected

57
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:22,480
every few years. Let's recap what we learned in this chapter. Bitcoin is peer-to-peer. It is a cash

58
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:27,120
system designed for individuals and companies are always an individual acting on their behalf.

59
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:33,120
H-oldling is irrational. It requires a willful ability to resist selling pressure that institutions

60
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:39,439
are structurally incapable of. Institutional failures in Bitcoin, FTX, Celseus, and others share

61
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:44,160
common themes of not respecting Bitcoin's nature. Corporate balance sheet holdings require a

62
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:53,199
dominant individual, like Sailor, to overcome institutional pressure to sell. BlackRock's ETF

63
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:59,600
may be the vehicle that finally brings institutional Bitcoin exposure by making it indirect and almost

64
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:08,399
invisible. In the next episode, we'll explore chapter 2. Bitcoin requires a deflationary mindset.

65
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:14,959
We'll examine why Bitcoin's fixed supply creates unique challenges for institutions accustomed

66
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:24,959
to inflationary thinking. See you in the next one.
