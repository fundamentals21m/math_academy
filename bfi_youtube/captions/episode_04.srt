1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Cryptography is ruthless, and there are two types of people in the world.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Those who have been burned and those who have yet to be.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Everybody is early to Bitcoin.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
It is only 16 years old, after all.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
In 2024, stories of Bitcoin being lost on hard drives are becoming rarer.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
But we still see high-profile reports of lost Bitcoin in significant amounts.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
This chapter explores why custody is perhaps the most critical challenge for institutions.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
In 2023, a former Bitcoin core developer, Luke Dashcher,

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,000
reportedly lost hundreds of Bitcoins in a setup that was supposedly too complicated for anybody to rescue.

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
These stories are becoming rarer because the hardware available to individuals for self-custody

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
has improved greatly in the past half decade.

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Hardware wallets have become extremely intuitive and easy to use.

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:52,000
The only real obstacle to Bitcoin's self-custody now is one's ability to protect a 12 or 24-word seed phrase.

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
That ability is no small thing.

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:01,000
There are a number of trade-offs to consider, and the reality is that it takes a long time of mulling through one's personal discomfort

16
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
before the security of your Bitcoin allows you to sleep soundly at night.

17
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:11,000
The soundest sleepers are those who have the least issue trusting someone to hold their seed for them.

18
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
But this is backwards and untenable.

19
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
It's not a foundation for individuals or institutions to build on.

20
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Holding Bitcoin in self-custody is not like holding fiat for a simple reason.

21
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:27,000
The likelihood of a mistake that makes the Bitcoin unspendable is much higher, and there is no bailout possible.

22
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Let me paint you a nightmare scenario for 2030.

23
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Imagine BlackRock's iBit ETF has acquired two million Bitcoin on behalf of its users.

24
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Bitcoin reaches gold's market capitalization of $20 trillion.

25
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
That's about $1 million per Bitcoin.

26
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:49,000
BlackRock's ETF would represent 10% of that value, or $2 trillion.

27
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:55,000
That's $2 trillion of value on balance sheets of companies all over the world.

28
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Now imagine we discover that BlackRock cannot sell back that Bitcoin because its custodian cannot perform the signatures required to move the keys.

29
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
BlackRock loses $2 trillion.

30
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,000
All of their customers have to write down 100% of that value on their balance sheets.

31
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Poof.

32
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Institutions that fail to take custody seriously will not only fail first, but also the most severely, with the potential to take down their industry and a portion of the financial system with them.

33
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,000
The world that understands BlackRock knows very little about their custodian coinbase.

34
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,000
The problems with coinbase being trusted to hold that much Bitcoin should concern everybody greatly.

35
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Let's look at the pros and cons.

36
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
On the pros side, coinbase has been doing custody for a long time.

37
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
That's about the only item in the pro column.

38
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:54,000
On the cons side, their custody technology predates best practices developed since the block size war, particularly segregated witness, or Segwit.

39
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Pre-Segwit addresses are vulnerable to the transaction-malleability problem that led to the legendary failure of Matt Gox exchange.

40
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,000
BlackRock spent the majority of the last decade hating Bitcoin until 2023.

41
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,000
They wanted to fast track their adoption, choosing speed over security.

42
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:20,000
When Bitwise made their addresses public, we discovered that Coinbase was holding the Bitcoin for the ETF in pre-Segwit addresses.

43
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
The one in front of the Bitcoin address told us this.

44
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:35,000
This is now a ticking time bomb on the scenario that in 2030, Coinbase's failure leads to the destruction of $2 trillion of value.

45
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Fidelity investments has a very successful spot, Bitcoin ETF, FBTC.

46
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:46,000
And in contrast to BlackRock, they manage all of the custody in-house themselves.

47
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Fidelity has been in Bitcoin for a very long time, the majority of the past decade.

48
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
They understood they could not trust Coinbase with the Sutter Maserah Sari.

49
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:03,000
They understood they could not trust any of the qualified custodians with their keys.

50
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,000
This gives Fidelity a substantial advantage over BlackRock due to their experience.

51
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Under the current level of opacity, there is no way to know if Fidelity is a more reliable custodian than Coinbase.

52
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:20,000
The only reason we know about Coinbase's technology limitations is because Bitwise made their addresses public,

53
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
and we were able to see the details.

54
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:34,000
The larger calculation of the ETF with regard to custody is that companies and individuals who aren't ready to deal with their own self-custody of Bitcoin can gain exposure through the ETF.

55
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Here's what the ETF provides. Easy exposure to Bitcoin's price volatility.

56
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:44,000
No need to understand self-custody. It fits into existing brokerage accounts.

57
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
It's a familiar investment vehicle structure.

58
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Here's what the ETF costs.

59
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
An enormous level of counterparty risk.

60
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
No ability to verify custody yourself.

61
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Dependence on the custodians' competence.

62
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
And it's not true Bitcoin ownership.

63
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,000
While gaining ETF exposure is a rational position for those not ready for self-custody,

64
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:13,000
it does not make for a landscape to provide robust solutions to the public using Bitcoin.

65
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:18,000
The ETF is capable of capturing the volatility of Bitcoin's price exposure.

66
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,000
But at an enormous level of counterparty risk, let's recap what we learned in this chapter.

67
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Hardware wallets have made self-custody accessible, but the only real obstacle remains one's ability to protect a 12 or 24-word seed phrase.

68
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
There is no bailout in Bitcoin.

69
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Mistakes that make Bitcoin unspendable are permanent and irreversible.

70
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Institutional custody failures could be catastrophic, potentially destroying trillions in value and taking down the financial system.

71
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Coinbase's legacy technology predates seguit best practices, creating systemic risk for ETFs using them as custodian.

72
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:02,000
ETFs provide price exposure, but enormous counterparty risk.

73
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,000
They are not a substitute for true Bitcoin ownership through self-custody.

74
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
In the next episode, we'll explore chapter 4.

75
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Bitcoin requires more, patience, and time than institutions have.

76
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:22,000
We'll examine why understanding Bitcoin is like learning multiple instruments at the same time.

77
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
See you in the next one.
