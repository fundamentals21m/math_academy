1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,439
When the money used by the world is hard to make and easy to validate,

2
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:06,320
it becomes an exceptional tool for capital accumulation,

3
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:10,320
coordination of trade, and generally aligning the incentives of spenders,

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:15,199
savers, entrepreneurs, and planners. This is the promise of Bitcoin.

5
00:00:15,199 --> 00:00:21,519
But can institutions capture this promise? That's the question this series will answer.

6
00:00:22,399 --> 00:00:27,600
Welcome to Bitcoin for Institutions. I'm Brian and this is Bitcoin for Institutions.

7
00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:32,479
An interactive video course exploring how institutional investors can approach the world's

8
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:37,920
largest fixed supply asset. Over the next 15 episodes, we'll work through three parts.

9
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:45,520
Bitcoin is for individuals, individuals run institutions, and institutional Bitcoin.

10
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:52,079
We'll explore why Bitcoin favors individuals, how key people drive institutional adoption,

11
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:57,520
and specific strategies for institutional Bitcoin exposure. A note before we begin.

12
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:03,359
This course presents a thesis that Bitcoin is fundamentally designed for individuals,

13
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:08,879
not institutions. Understanding this tension is critical for any organization that aspires to

14
00:01:08,879 --> 00:01:15,200
use Bitcoin successfully. Let's begin. Is Bitcoin not Bitcoin? Does its ownership change its

15
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:21,599
properties? The answer, perhaps surprisingly, is yes. The power of Bitcoin as capital

16
00:01:21,599 --> 00:01:26,799
is fundamentally determined by its owner. Under a system of hard money, capital flows into the

17
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:33,200
strongest and most capable hands. Entrepreneurs who make the best capital allocation decisions

18
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:38,879
end up keeping their capital. While those who make poor decisions see their capital flow to those

19
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:43,760
who better meet the demands of the market. This creates a fundamental asymmetry.

20
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:50,079
Individuals who hold their own keys have full control. They can build circular economies.

21
00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:56,480
They have patient, long-term time horizons. They value privacy and sovereignty.

22
00:01:57,359 --> 00:02:01,920
Institutions face structural challenges. Custody requires intermediaries.

23
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,120
Quarterly performance pressure drives short-term thinking.

24
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:11,599
Regulatory and compliance constraints limit flexibility. Fiduciary duties override individual

25
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:17,439
conviction. Money by decree is no different from that which is counterfeit. No group of humans in

26
00:02:17,439 --> 00:02:22,319
history with the power to print money has ever proven itself capable of resisting the temptation to

27
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:27,759
do so. From the earliest traders with glass beads through the coin clipping Roman emperors

28
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:32,960
to the counterfeiting politicians and central bankers of today, the pattern repeats endlessly.

29
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:39,039
A decree that cannot be resisted is considered tyranny. Bitcoin frees individuals from a kind of

30
00:02:39,039 --> 00:02:44,800
tyranny that most people don't realize exists. By creating money that cannot be debased by decree,

31
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:49,039
Bitcoin enables individuals to preserve the fruits of their labor across time.

32
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:54,400
A capability that was previously available only to those with access, to scarce, physical,

33
00:02:54,400 --> 00:03:00,319
assets like gold or land. It is a misconception that the game is to build the biggest stack.

34
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:05,439
The game is to accumulate the most powerful form of capital. While all Bitcoin is treated as

35
00:03:05,439 --> 00:03:11,360
fungible, the truth is that the power of the capital is determined by its owner. Strong holders,

36
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,479
those with earning potential and value add capabilities, have more optionality and power with

37
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:21,520
their Bitcoin. Bitcoin holders who build circular economies and trading networks create more

38
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:27,360
powerful capital than passive accumulators. Even dedicated institutions like Strategy will act

39
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:33,039
like individuals with limited power in the Bitcoin economy. This is the first insight institutions

40
00:03:33,039 --> 00:03:38,639
must grasp. The quantity of Bitcoin matters less than the quality of the holder. This course is

41
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:43,680
organized into three parts, progressing from the fundamental nature of Bitcoin to specific

42
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:50,560
institutional strategies. Part 1. Bitcoin is for individuals. We'll explore why individuals have

43
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:57,439
structural advantages over institutions and holding Bitcoin. Topics include why ShowDLEing

44
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:02,800
is irrational, the deflationary mindset, custody trade-offs, time preference,

45
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:12,319
bearer asset properties and privacy. Part 2. Individuals run institutions. We'll examine how key

46
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:17,759
individuals drive institutional adoption, focusing on Michael's Sailor's Strategy and Black Rock's

47
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:25,279
transformation under Larry Fink. Part 3. Institutional Bitcoin. We'll cover specific use cases,

48
00:04:25,279 --> 00:04:31,519
deferred compensation, ETFs, Treasury management, structured credit and pensions,

49
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:36,720
culminating in frameworks for institutional Bitcoin exposure. Each episode builds on the

50
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:41,920
previous, creating a comprehensive understanding of Bitcoin from an institutional perspective.

51
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:48,399
Before diving into the chapters, let's establish five foundational concepts. First, hard money.

52
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:53,600
Money that is difficult to produce and easy to verify, enabling capital accumulation and

53
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:59,759
rational economic calculation. Bitcoin is the hardest money ever created, with a fixed supply

54
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:09,759
cap of 21 million and global instant verifiability. Second, bearer asset. An asset that grants ownership to

55
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:16,319
whoever possesses it without requiring any intermediary to validate the claim. Bitcoin is a digital

56
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:23,519
bearer asset, whoever controls the private keys controls the Bitcoin. Third, circular economy.

57
00:05:24,079 --> 00:05:29,279
An economic system where goods and services are exchanged directly for Bitcoin without converting

58
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:36,160
back to fiat currency. Individuals who build circular economies have more powerful Bitcoin than

59
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:43,519
those who simply accumulate. Fourth, counterparty risk. The risk that another party in a financial

60
00:05:43,519 --> 00:05:50,240
transaction will fail to fulfill their obligations. Institutional Bitcoin often introduces counter-party

61
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:57,839
risks that self-custody eliminates. Fifth, time preference. The relative valuation placed on

62
00:05:57,839 --> 00:06:04,480
present goods versus future goods. Individuals typically have lower time preference than institutions,

63
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:09,680
giving them an advantage in holding Bitcoin long-term. Let's recap what we covered in this introduction.

64
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:15,439
Bitcoin empowers individuals in ways that institutions cannot fully replicate due to structural

65
00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:21,120
constraints. The power of Bitcoin as capital depends on its owner. Not just the quantity held.

66
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:26,319
Hard money enables capital to flow to those who make the best allocation decisions.

67
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:32,720
Soft money. Fiat currency represents a form of tyranny that Bitcoin seeks to address.

68
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:39,040
Institutions must understand why individuals value Bitcoin to successfully integrated into

69
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:46,800
their strategies. In the next episode, we'll examine chapter one. Hodling. Bitcoin is irrational.

70
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:51,600
We'll explore why the rational approach to Bitcoin may not be what you think, and why institutional

71
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:58,079
failures like FTX and Celsius share common themes. If you found this helpful, subscribe and check
