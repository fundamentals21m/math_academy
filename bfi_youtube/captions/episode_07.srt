1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,360
A byproduct of being responsible for one's own private keys is a natural desire for privacy.

2
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:10,480
This is a thorny issue because most people are conditioned to be willing to give up their privacy around money.

3
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:17,039
But as we'll see in this chapter, the freedom to transact without surveillance may be one of Bitcoin's most important properties.

4
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:21,519
China is already using a CBDC, a central bank digital currency,

5
00:00:21,519 --> 00:00:25,440
and that has given Western society a preview of the nightmare we will experience

6
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:30,480
if we allow our governments to implement a totalitarian panopticon around money and spending.

7
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:36,159
Most people using Bitcoin are doing so strictly for price exposure and don't care about maintaining privacy.

8
00:00:36,159 --> 00:00:37,520
But they should.

9
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:43,200
They will be looking for more and more solutions to regain their privacy as the central banks tighten their grip further.

10
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:50,479
There are many people that believe that the freedom to transact is a natural right and a natural extension of freedom of speech.

11
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:54,719
In the digital world, monetary transactions are little more than messages,

12
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:57,359
not different from texts or emails.

13
00:00:57,359 --> 00:01:02,079
Like with speech, there cannot be truly free markets without the total freedom to transact.

14
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:08,159
The US uses its status as the central issuer of the world's current reserve currency, the US dollar,

15
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:15,359
and the world's reserve asset, US government bonds, to maintain its status as the dominant leader in the world.

16
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:23,040
The US uses Swift Payment Network Access to provide oversight over seemingly every transaction in the global financial system.

17
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:29,439
Know your customer and anti-money laundering regulations claim that nobody transacting has any right to privacy.

18
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:34,319
The reality is that the majority of criminal activity in the world happens in US dollars.

19
00:01:34,319 --> 00:01:38,239
A much preferred network for crime than an unencrypted public ledger.

20
00:01:38,239 --> 00:01:43,680
These regulations have strangled innovation and made it untenable for companies to operate honestly,

21
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,760
causing many to leave the US for friendlier jurisdictions.

22
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:54,799
The Canadian Freedom Convoy in January of 2022 brought this privacy issue to light when it comes to personal spending.

23
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:58,079
Whether you agree or not with what the truckers were protesting,

24
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:07,120
many people in Canada and the US appreciated their fight and wanted to support them by donating money for clothing and firewood.

25
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:12,400
Several methods of donating were established that raised millions of dollars for these truckers,

26
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:18,319
which never saw their way into their hands as a result of direct intervention by the Trudeau government.

27
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:23,199
GoFundMe raised 10 million Canadian dollars.

28
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:29,039
Only about 1 million was released before the platform was forced to take action by the government.

29
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:34,159
After GoFundMe was blocked, supporters turned to give send Go.

30
00:02:34,719 --> 00:02:43,120
They collected $9.58 million, 44% from the United States, over 109,000 donations.

31
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:48,000
The Canadian government worked to block protesters access to these funds as well,

32
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,479
but the intervention didn't end at the blockade.

33
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:55,360
The Trudeau government invoked the Emergencies Act in order to freeze the bank accounts of the individuals

34
00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:01,199
who donated to the protests. Banks were told they can't provide any financial or related services

35
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:05,759
to people associated with the protests, a move that resulted in frozen accounts,

36
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:08,080
stranded money, and cancelled credit cards.

37
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:13,919
Most people have likely never heard of a GoFundMe campaign being hijacked and redirected by a government.

38
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:20,400
This was an unprecedented display of financial surveillance and control over peaceful citizens.

39
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:26,479
The Canadian Freedom Convoy demonstrated exactly why Bitcoin users value privacy.

40
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:32,479
When governments can block crowdfunding platforms, freeze bank accounts for political views,

41
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:38,080
cancel credit cards for donating to legal causes, and track and punish donors to political movements.

42
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:42,800
Then the need for a censorship-resistant permissionless money becomes self-evident.

43
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:48,560
Bitcoin held in self-custody could not have been blocked, frozen, or redirected by any government.

44
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:52,800
Bitcoin users will increasingly demand privacy-preserving solutions.

45
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:57,919
Institutions that don't understand this fundamental value proposition will find themselves

46
00:03:57,919 --> 00:04:01,680
offering products that sophisticated Bitcoin users don't want.

47
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:07,840
The current idea most individuals and institutions have about using Bitcoin is solely for its

48
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:13,280
price exposure, with very little to do with the powerful property of it as a digital bearer asset.

49
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:19,360
This just underscores how early we all are and how little the majority of the world understands

50
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:25,680
Bitcoin. Let's recap what we learned in this chapter. CBDC's Threat and Financial Privacy.

51
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:31,519
China's CBDC is a preview of the totalitarian Panopticon Western governments could implement.

52
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:36,800
Freedom to transact is an extension of free speech, monetary transactions in the digital world are

53
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:41,920
just messages. The Freedom Convoy showed government power over money. Crowdfunding was blocked,

54
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:47,839
bank accounts were frozen, and credit cards were cancelled. KYC AML regulations are weaponized.

55
00:04:47,839 --> 00:04:52,800
While most crime happens in dollars, these regulations strangle innovation and honest business.

56
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:58,800
Bitcoin in self-custody is censorship resistant. It could not have been blocked, frozen,

57
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:06,800
or redirected by any government. This concludes Part 1. Bitcoin is for individuals.

58
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:15,439
In the next episode, we begin Part 2. Individuals run institutions, starting with strategy.

59
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:20,959
The company formerly known as MicroStrategy. And how Michael Saler proved that one

60
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:32,399
individual can make institutional Bitcoin work. See you in the next one.
