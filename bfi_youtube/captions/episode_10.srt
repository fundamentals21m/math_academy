1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,040
Holding a Bitcoin Treasury and using it in lieu of ETFs is a superior strategy that eliminates

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:07,799
the counterparty credit risk entirely.

3
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:12,560
Deferred compensation is one of the most powerful tools for executives and highly compensated

4
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:16,440
employees to gain Bitcoin exposure through their employers.

5
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:20,760
This chapter explores how companies can use non-qualified deferred compensation plans

6
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:27,280
to offer Bitcoin benefits, non-qualified deferred compensation plans, NQDC plans, allow

7
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:32,560
highly compensated employees to defer a portion of their compensation to a future date.

8
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:38,920
Unlike 401K plans, NQDC plans are not subject to a rise of regulations and have no contribution

9
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:40,039
limits.

10
00:00:40,039 --> 00:00:44,439
This makes them ideal for significant Bitcoin accumulation.

11
00:00:44,439 --> 00:00:47,240
Executives can defer unlimited amounts.

12
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:51,659
Taxes are deferred until distribution, allowing Bitcoin gains to compound without annual

13
00:00:51,659 --> 00:00:53,359
tax drag.

14
00:00:53,359 --> 00:00:56,280
Companies have broad discretion over investment options.

15
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:02,880
They can offer Bitcoin when 401K plans cannot and deferred amounts typically vest over time,

16
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:07,120
creating golden handcuffs, retention incentives for key employees.

17
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:09,599
There's an important trade-off to understand.

18
00:01:09,599 --> 00:01:13,040
NQDC plans are not protected by a riser.

19
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,480
Participants are unsecured creditors of the company.

20
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:19,519
If the company goes bankrupt, they may lose their deferred compensation.

21
00:01:19,519 --> 00:01:22,079
This is why it's called riding the wave.

22
00:01:22,079 --> 00:01:24,200
You're tied to the company's fate.

23
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:28,319
But for Bitcoin, this creates a unique alignment of interests.

24
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:32,959
The company and the executive both benefit from Bitcoin's appreciation, creating shared

25
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:34,239
incentives.

26
00:01:34,239 --> 00:01:37,000
Why is NQDC perfect for Bitcoin?

27
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,239
First, long-time horizons.

28
00:01:40,239 --> 00:01:44,840
Executives typically defer for 10 to 20 plus years, aligning with Bitcoin's optimal holding

29
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:45,840
period.

30
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,079
Second, tax-deferred growth.

31
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:53,599
Bitcoin's volatility becomes less relevant when gains compound tax-free for decades.

32
00:01:53,599 --> 00:01:56,480
Third, no contribution limits.

33
00:01:56,480 --> 00:02:00,200
High earners can allocate significant amounts to Bitcoin exposure.

34
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,920
Fourth, company alignment.

35
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:07,280
It creates shared interest between company and executive in Bitcoin's success.

36
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,919
There are two main implementation options.

37
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:14,319
Option one, use Bitcoin ETFs like IBIT or FBTC.

38
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:18,800
This is the easiest to implement, standard custody through the ETF provider.

39
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,599
But it comes with counterparty risk from the ETF and custodian.

40
00:02:22,599 --> 00:02:25,000
Option two, direct treasury.

41
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,120
The company holds actual Bitcoin.

42
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,639
This eliminates ETF counterparty risk.

43
00:02:29,639 --> 00:02:34,840
It requires custody infrastructure to be built, but it's the superior long-term solution.

44
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:40,439
The recommended approach is to start with ETFs to get the program operational quickly.

45
00:02:40,439 --> 00:02:44,080
Then build internal Bitcoin custody capability.

46
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:50,800
Finally, transition to company-held Bitcoin treasury to back the NQDC program, eliminating

47
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,680
all counterparty risk.

48
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:58,120
When a company offers Bitcoin in its NQDC plan, it may need to hedge the exposure.

49
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:03,360
If an executive defers $1 million into a Bitcoin option and Bitcoin triples, the company

50
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,400
owes $3 million.

51
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,919
They need to have actually bought the Bitcoin.

52
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:14,199
It may be that none of the available ETFs would satisfy robust due diligence.

53
00:03:14,199 --> 00:03:19,960
A golden opportunity exists for someone to create an ETF exclusively used for hedging

54
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,719
Bitcoin exposure.

55
00:03:21,719 --> 00:03:26,800
Optimized for delivering price exposure as closely as possible, reducing custodial risk

56
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:31,919
to an absolute minimum, and providing complete transparency with ongoing proof of digital

57
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:35,439
signatures, let's recap what we learned in this chapter.

58
00:03:35,439 --> 00:03:40,680
NQDC plans have no contribution limits and broad investment discretion, making them ideal

59
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,520
for Bitcoin exposure.

60
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:46,439
The ARIASA trade-off means participants are unsecured creditors.

61
00:03:46,439 --> 00:03:50,360
They are writing the wave with the company's fate.

62
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:52,400
Start with ETFs.

63
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,400
Evolve to treasury.

64
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:59,759
Use ETFs to launch quickly, then build toward company-held Bitcoin.

65
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:02,719
Direct treasury eliminates counterparty risk.

66
00:04:02,719 --> 00:04:08,599
The superior long-term solution removes all ETFs and custodial dependencies.

67
00:04:08,599 --> 00:04:12,840
Long-time horizons align perfectly.

68
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:18,560
Use deferring for 10-20-plus years match Bitcoin's optimal holding period.

69
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:23,439
In the next episode, we'll explore mutual funds and ETFs.

70
00:04:23,439 --> 00:04:28,439
How fund managers can integrate Bitcoin to dramatically improve portfolio performance.

71
00:04:28,439 --> 00:04:29,199
See you in the next one.
