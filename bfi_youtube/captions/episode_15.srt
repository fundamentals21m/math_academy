1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,120
If Bitcoin is going to help the current financial system transcend the problems of previous systems,

2
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:10,160
then institutions that wish to utilize it are going to need to develop optics and metrics that

3
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:17,199
demonstrate success and failure. After 30 years as an actuary, determining investment strategies

4
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:22,719
for pensions, running hedging operations, and explaining P&L performance for guaranteed

5
00:00:22,719 --> 00:00:28,960
annuities. My career has followed a trajectory that fits perfectly with the moment we find ourselves

6
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:34,960
in with Bitcoin. The lessons learned from institutional failures applied directly to Bitcoin

7
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:40,880
adoption today. In 2003, a mentor came up with a novel idea about how to manage pensions that

8
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:47,520
would become known as liability-driven investing, or LDI. The message was clear. Investment returns

9
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:52,079
aren't the key driver of a pensions ability to meet its liabilities. Protection against rates

10
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:58,240
dropping is. Liabilities had large exposures to rates, but very small exposures to equities.

11
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:04,319
Equity returns were prioritized because of a confluence of incentives, and those with executives

12
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:09,920
ears were ignorant of the risks we were illustrating. This is the most pertinent parallel to where we

13
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:16,719
are today with Bitcoin. The ruthless and tractability of institutional incentives. LDI became very

14
00:01:16,719 --> 00:01:22,000
popular in the UK, but companies that offset liability increases with investment gains ultimately

15
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,319
leveraged them via borrowing, causing the very bank of England bailout that demonstrated the

16
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:31,920
system's fragility. The agency problem that caused US corporate pensions to willfully ignore LDI

17
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:37,439
was driven by inadequate reporting. This will be a common theme for all companies regarding Bitcoin.

18
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:44,079
Pension managers only saw asset returns from investment consultants. Everything was in an asset

19
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:51,040
only framework that defined benchmarks, strategies, and the goal of beating the S&P 500.

20
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:57,680
But beating the S&P by 50 basis points when it returns negative 20% doesn't help the pension at all.

21
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:04,959
Without liability integrated reporting, managers couldn't see this truth. A CFO telling the CEO,

22
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:11,360
the pension is doing great when bonds lost 30% was too much career risk. Even if liabilities also

23
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:18,400
dropped 30%. The market doesn't know how to value strategy, MSTR, because they don't know how to

24
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:25,599
associate value with their Bitcoin treasury. Same problem. New asset. The accounting standards FAS87

25
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:32,240
and FAS132 will go down in history as one of the great unintended consequences ever. Companies could

26
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:37,680
assume an 8% return regardless of actual performance, taking a direct credit toward earnings.

27
00:02:38,479 --> 00:02:44,479
Bad years were amortized over 15 plus years, masking the true impact of underperformance.

28
00:02:45,759 --> 00:02:50,800
CFOs derived bonuses from these earnings and were obstinately unwilling to put them at risk.

29
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:57,840
The tail wagged the dog, equity heavy strategies were chosen to hit 8% regardless of liability

30
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:04,080
exposure. Just as these standards derailed pension reform, the goodwill treatment of Bitcoin

31
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:09,520
dissuaded companies from substantial balance sheet allocations. Until FASB fixed it with

32
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:14,319
mark-to-market treatment. If Bitcoin is going to help the current financial system transcend the

33
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:19,039
problems of previous systems, institutions will need to develop new optics and metrics.

34
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:25,280
Pensions need to measure overall funded status or projected time to termination, not just asset

35
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:30,479
returns. Corporate balance sheets need a redefinition of balance sheet strength, emphasizing future

36
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:35,599
value over present value. Structured credit needs a redefinition of credit quality factoring in

37
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:41,759
Bitcoin's impact on subordination and seniority. Asset managers like BlackRock need to track clients

38
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:47,520
overall allocation to Bitcoin. In the absence of these new optics, any institution's efforts to

39
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:52,560
take advantage of Bitcoin will be temporary, and they will be no more resilient to a calamity

40
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:57,120
than they were before their participation in the space. Let me summarize the key lessons from

41
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:03,199
this entire series. For investors, Bitcoin is the greatest performing asset in history despite

42
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:09,360
drawdowns. Drawdowns are structural and have always recovered to all-time highs. Small allocations

43
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:16,720
cause significant outperformance. Don't be unintentionally short Bitcoin. For fiduciaries,

44
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:24,399
fiduciary liability exposure exists from not offering Bitcoin. Drawdowns are short, returns are

45
00:04:24,399 --> 00:04:29,600
enduring. You're more likely to face a lawsuit for lack of returns than drawdown losses.

46
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:36,319
For executives, you don't need to hold Bitcoin on treasury to benefit. Less risky options include

47
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:42,720
NQDC and selling into rising markets. You can lower operating costs without balance sheet risk.

48
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:47,680
The lessons from three decades of institutional finance are clear. Incentives matter more than

49
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:53,040
logic, reporting frameworks determine strategy and accounting standards can derail even the most

50
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:58,399
sensible reforms. Bitcoin represents the opportunity to transcend the systemic failures,

51
00:04:58,959 --> 00:05:02,720
but only if institutions develop the right frameworks for measuring success.

52
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:09,040
Without new metrics that capture Bitcoin's unique properties, institutional adoption will remain

53
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:14,480
temporary and fragile. For those who want to dive deeper, I recommend the Bitcoin standard by

58
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:48,000
institutions. Thank you for watching this series. I hope it has provided valuable frameworks for

59
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:54,319
thinking about Bitcoin from an institutional perspective. The key takeaways, Bitcoin is fundamentally

60
00:05:54,319 --> 00:06:00,879
for individuals, but individuals run institutions. Understanding this tension is critical for success.

61
00:06:01,839 --> 00:06:06,800
Institutional resistance is ruthless, but it can be overcome with the right metrics,

62
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:12,720
the right frameworks, and the right individuals driving change. The opportunity is real,

63
00:06:13,519 --> 00:06:16,480
but only for those who develop proper institutional frameworks.
