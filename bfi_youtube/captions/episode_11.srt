1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,400
Using Bitcoin in funds is the most obvious and non-thinking way for a fund,

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:10,320
their investors and their investors' shareholders, to sleepwalk their way to unimaginable wealth.

3
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:13,839
Despite being declared dead many times by mainstream media,

4
00:00:13,839 --> 00:00:20,239
declared useless by respected economists, and called only useful to money-launders by Larry Fink.

5
00:00:20,239 --> 00:00:23,600
Bitcoin closed 2024 near all-time highs.

6
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:28,960
Ordinary people who simply held Bitcoin outperformed every hedge fund, mutual fund,

7
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:34,479
and special purpose fund. If you are a mutual fund manager reading this and your company still

8
00:00:34,479 --> 00:00:40,159
isn't offering Bitcoin, you must wonder what they're doing. What are all of those employees

9
00:00:40,159 --> 00:00:45,520
actually doing all day? There are tens, maybe hundreds of thousands of ordinary people,

10
00:00:46,159 --> 00:00:50,479
most of whom would never pass the hiring process of any investment company,

11
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:57,039
who have massively outperformed every professional fund manager simply by buying and holding Bitcoin.

12
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:03,600
Bitcoin's 16-year return history makes it the best performing asset class in history,

13
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:06,799
despite massive drawdowns along the way.

14
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:11,840
Professional money managers who ignored it have significant explaining to do.

15
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:16,400
Research consistently shows that even small allocations to Bitcoin can dramatically improve

16
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:23,040
portfolio metrics. A traditional 60-40 portfolio with zero Bitcoin might return 8% with a sharp

17
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:30,959
ratio of 0.53. Add just 1% Bitcoin, and you're looking at over 9% returns with a sharp ratio of

18
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:41,920
0.60. At 2% allocation, your over 10% returns with a sharp ratio of 0.66. At 5%, you're at 14%

19
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:48,799
returns with a sharp ratio of 0.80. The improvement in risk-adjusted returns is remarkable for such small

20
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:55,680
allocations. The volatility increases modest, but the return improvement is substantial.

21
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:00,719
The traditional concern is that fiduciaries face liability for including Bitcoin and experiencing

22
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:06,719
drawdowns, but the calculus is shifting, the old view. We can't include Bitcoin because if it

23
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:15,840
drops 50%, we'll be sued. The new view. If we don't include Bitcoin, and it 10Xs, while our competitors

24
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:22,240
include it, we'll be sued for not including it. Bitcoin drawdowns are temporary,

25
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:28,879
historically always recovering to new highs, but missing Bitcoin's appreciation is permanent.

26
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:35,039
Fiduciaries face greater long-term risk from exclusion than inclusion. Many funds have unintentional

27
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:40,000
short exposure to Bitcoin through their positions. Banks compete with Bitcoin for the store-of-value

28
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,360
function. Payment processors compete with Bitcoin's payment rails. Fiat currencies are in direct

29
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:52,000
competition for the monetary premium. Long duration bonds serve the same role as a monetary hedge.

30
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:59,520
Gold miners are in direct competition as hard money. If your fund holds these assets without

31
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:05,360
Bitcoin exposure, you may be structurally short Bitcoin, even without intending to be. Target

32
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:11,280
date funds represent the single largest opportunity for Bitcoin integration. They hold trillions in assets,

33
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:17,599
even 1% Bitcoin allocation would create massive demand. Young workers have 30 to 40-year horizons,

34
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:23,199
perfect for Bitcoin's volatility profile. Target date fund investors are passive. They won't panic

35
00:03:23,199 --> 00:03:27,759
sell during drawdowns because they don't watch daily prices. And the structure naturally

36
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:33,840
rebalances, selling high and buying low over time. These, sedate and forget it funds for retirement

37
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:38,879
savers could include Bitcoin in their equity allocation with minimal friction. Let's recap what we

38
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:44,800
learned in this chapter. Ordinary Bitcoin holders outperformed every professional fund. Fund

39
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:50,560
managers who ignored Bitcoin have explaining to do. Small allocations generate significant alpha.

40
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:58,240
Even 1% to 2% Bitcoin can meaningfully improve portfolio sharp ratios. Fiduciary risk is shifting.

41
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:04,400
The greater liability may now be from not including Bitcoin rather than including it. Don't be

42
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:10,639
unintentionally short Bitcoin. Holdings in banks, payment processors, and bonds may create hidden

43
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:15,599
short exposure. Target date funds are the biggest opportunity, trillions in assets with long

44
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:20,800
horizons and passive investors. In the next episode, we'll explore treasury and balance sheet

45
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:27,040
strategies. How companies can use Bitcoin treasuries beyond just holding for appreciation. See you in

46
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,560
the next one.
