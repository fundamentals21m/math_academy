1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,639
I'd say that there are about six minutes left in the game, and it is time to pull the goalie.

2
00:00:04,639 --> 00:00:05,799
Bitcoin is ready.

3
00:00:05,799 --> 00:00:08,880
Pensions are the king when it comes to OPM expertise.

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:11,580
By OPM, I mean other people's money.

5
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:15,439
Everybody is an expert on how to manage other people's money and nothing

6
00:00:15,439 --> 00:00:20,079
brings out people's greatest and wildest ideas like pensions.

7
00:00:20,079 --> 00:00:23,559
There is very little written about pensions that is truly original.

8
00:00:23,559 --> 00:00:29,600
But as an actuary with 30 years of experience who understands both pensions and Bitcoin, deeply.

9
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:31,480
Some insights can be offered.

10
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:35,520
There is one juicy apple to pick from the tree of institutional finance.

11
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:40,759
Tax-qualified pension plans don't ever pay capital gains tax on their investments.

12
00:00:40,759 --> 00:00:45,880
This is a known advantage that pension plans exploit by loading their trusts with equities.

13
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:47,399
What hasn't been done?

14
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:57,359
Companies loading their pension trusts with Bitcoin or Bitcoin proxies, hoping to exploit their ability to enjoy Bitcoin's superior returns.

15
00:00:57,359 --> 00:01:01,520
Tax-free over a significantly long time horizon.

16
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:02,799
What should happen?

17
00:01:02,799 --> 00:01:08,359
Companies starting new qualified pension plans to accumulate Bitcoin tax-free.

18
00:01:08,359 --> 00:01:14,719
Outside of a Roth IRA, there aren't really any other ways to accumulate Bitcoin gains on a tax-free basis.

19
00:01:14,719 --> 00:01:21,599
It would make sense for owners of small companies under 100 employees to offer a defined benefit plan

20
00:01:21,599 --> 00:01:24,439
and maximize their contributions in Bitcoin,

21
00:01:24,439 --> 00:01:28,400
considering that some pension plans invested in criminal crypto enterprises.

22
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:33,120
One would think that putting some small allocation into actual Bitcoin would be obvious.

23
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:37,920
Ontario Teachers Pension Plan invested $100 million in FTX.

24
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:38,920
Result.

25
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:39,760
Bankrupt.

26
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:41,879
CEO in prison.

27
00:01:41,879 --> 00:01:45,920
CDPQ invested $150 million in Celsius.

28
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,200
Result.

29
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,239
Bankrupt.

30
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:50,400
CEO in prison.

31
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,719
The irony is painful.

32
00:01:52,719 --> 00:01:59,640
Major pension funds invested hundreds of millions in fraudulent crypto enterprises that are now bankrupt with executives in prison.

33
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:03,599
Yet they hesitate to allocate even small amounts to actual Bitcoin.

34
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:08,159
In 2018, Aaron Brown, author of Poker Face of Wall Street,

35
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:12,439
co-wrote a paper with Clifford Asnuss about a strategy called Pulling the Golly.

36
00:02:12,439 --> 00:02:13,800
The name comes from hockey.

37
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:18,879
When a team is losing near the end of a game, they pull their goalkeeper to add an extra attacker.

38
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:23,080
Compare this to football's Hail Mary with a success rate of about 8%.

39
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:26,560
A desperate move with nearly no likelihood of success.

40
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:31,240
Pulling the Golly has a success rate of 18 to 20% more than double.

41
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:33,400
The key insight from the paper.

42
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:38,120
The most basic lesson is to make sure you are thinking about the right risk.

43
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:41,680
Pulling the Golly actually reduces the risk of losing the game.

44
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,599
It's an insurance move.

45
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:50,280
A key determinant of whether it pays to pull the Golly is how much time is left in the game.

46
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:54,039
It made sense to pull the Golly with six minutes left.

47
00:02:54,039 --> 00:03:00,360
An uncomfortably long time that seems unintuitive, but maximizes winning probability.

48
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:05,879
Pensions are in need of a strategy that increases volatility, and Bitcoin is the perfect solution.

49
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:09,080
There isn't much more that should be said as far as allocation goes.

50
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:12,960
It should be 100% given that pensions are a medium-term problem,

51
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,319
and most will outlive the next two Bitcoin having cycles.

52
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:17,719
That's eight years.

53
00:03:17,719 --> 00:03:21,080
Pensions are not a long-term issue nor impending doom.

54
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:23,879
Most will survive at least eight more years.

55
00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:26,599
There are only so many more bailouts available.

56
00:03:26,599 --> 00:03:31,479
Given the state of fiat money, we shouldn't be overconfident in pensions lifespan.

57
00:03:31,479 --> 00:03:33,800
There are about six minutes left in the game.

58
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,759
Bitcoin is ready.

59
00:03:35,759 --> 00:03:39,719
The volatility increase is actually the correct risk measure for winning.

60
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:42,080
Pensions need to think about the right risk.

61
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:47,840
Not volatility of returns, but probability of meeting their obligations.

62
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:51,159
Here are specific recommendations for pension managers.

63
00:03:51,159 --> 00:03:53,199
Embrace what BlackRock will do.

64
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:57,120
Leverage their Bitcoin ETF and mutual fund infrastructure.

65
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,199
Offer Bitcoin in NQDC.

66
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:03,319
Non-qualified deferred compensation plans can include Bitcoin.

67
00:04:03,319 --> 00:04:05,159
Utilize enhanced funds.

68
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:07,199
Use funds enhanced with Bitcoin.

69
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:09,159
Consider higher allocations.

70
00:04:09,159 --> 00:04:11,080
Avoid shorts and hedges.

71
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:14,080
Don't be unintentionally short Bitcoin exposure.

72
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,639
Utilize structured credit arbitrage.

73
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:19,759
Take advantage of Bitcoin as collateral opportunities.

74
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:22,519
Build robust self-custody operations.

75
00:04:22,519 --> 00:04:26,639
Use BlackRock ETF while developing internal capabilities.

76
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:28,680
Create a 10-year termination plan.

77
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:32,240
Work toward pension termination over maximum 10 years.

78
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,839
Utilize the PBGC put.

79
00:04:34,839 --> 00:04:37,639
Knowing executives are taken care of with NQDC.

80
00:04:37,639 --> 00:04:40,279
Let's recap what we learned in this chapter.

81
00:04:40,279 --> 00:04:43,680
Tax-qualified pensions don't pay capital gains tax.

82
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:48,240
A massive advantage for accumulating Bitcoin gains over long-time horizons.

83
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:54,920
Small employers should consider new pension plans as a tax-advantaged vehicle for Bitcoin accumulation.

84
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:57,519
Pulling the goalie is the right analogy.

85
00:04:57,519 --> 00:05:03,000
Increasing volatility through Bitcoin actually reduces the risk of not meeting obligations.

86
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,360
There are six minutes left in the game.

87
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:10,240
There are limited bailouts remaining and pensions need to act now.

88
00:05:10,879 --> 00:05:17,199
100% allocation is justified for pensions that will survive the next two having cycles.

89
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:18,959
Eight years.

90
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:22,279
In the final episode we'll explore the epilogue.

91
00:05:22,279 --> 00:05:27,600
Metrics and frameworks needed for institutions to successfully adopt Bitcoin long term.

92
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,600
See you in the next one.
