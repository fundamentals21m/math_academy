1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,320
The world came to the realization that there does not exist a risk-free asset.

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:09,960
And at the same time, they would grapple with the question of where Bitcoin belongs in an investment portfolio.

3
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:15,960
BlackRock was the largest investment manager of pension schemes, utilizing a strategy called

4
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:19,600
liability-driven investments.

5
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:25,859
Understanding their history with LDI is crucial to understanding why they pivoted so dramatically to Bitcoin.

6
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:33,259
The idea behind liability-driven investing is that the return on pension assets isn't as important as the return relative to the liability.

7
00:00:33,259 --> 00:00:41,380
If the S&P 500 goes down by 20%, but your investment manager only goes down by 19%, they would be lauded as heroes.

8
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:44,899
Even though the plan now has a large hold of fill.

9
00:00:44,899 --> 00:00:51,500
If interest rates decrease by 100 basis points, pension liabilities increase by around 12%.

10
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:56,659
So the plan should want either an investment or a hedge that pays off that 12%.

11
00:00:56,659 --> 00:01:03,740
Long-duration bonds were one of the greatest performing asset classes from 2004 through 2022.

12
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:05,780
Rates went straight down.

13
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:12,859
If you forgot they were tracking a liability, you might confuse pension assets with gains available for company operations.

14
00:01:12,859 --> 00:01:18,620
Companies were accessing their gains without selling assets by borrowing against them.

15
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:24,379
They posted bonds with unrealized gains as collateral for loans to fund operations.

16
00:01:24,379 --> 00:01:31,140
This practice took place without incident as long as interest rates continued to decrease or stay the same.

17
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:35,819
But if rates changed direction, the collateral backing the loans decreases in value.

18
00:01:35,819 --> 00:01:38,739
In 2022, the time bomb went off.

19
00:01:38,739 --> 00:01:40,340
The Fed raised rates.

20
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:43,980
Long-duration bonds lost 30% to 50% of value.

21
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:49,659
The UK guilt crisis in September 2022 required a bank of England emergency bailout.

22
00:01:49,659 --> 00:01:56,379
In 2023, five major US banks failed, Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank, and others.

23
00:01:56,379 --> 00:02:04,980
The structural underpinning of virtually every investment portfolio in the world is the idea of a risk-free asset and high-quality government bonds.

24
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:11,500
This was devastated in 2022 because those risk-free assets performed horribly.

25
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:17,860
The capital asset pricing model and modern portfolio theory are built on a foundation of a risk-free asset.

26
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:21,659
When that foundation crumbles, everything must be rethought.

27
00:02:21,659 --> 00:02:26,340
Larry Fink famously called Bitcoin only useful to money-launders.

28
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:34,539
Yet in 2023, BlackRock filed for a spot Bitcoin ETF and has become one of Bitcoin's most significant institutional advocates.

29
00:02:34,539 --> 00:02:35,819
What changed?

30
00:02:35,819 --> 00:02:39,500
The IBIT ETF launched in January 2024.

31
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:44,419
It reached over $50 billion in assets under management in its first year.

32
00:02:44,419 --> 00:02:55,780
It broke every ETF record, fastest to $10 billion, $20 billion, $30 billion, $40 billion, and $50 billion in AUM.

33
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:59,139
This validated Bitcoin as an institutional asset class.

34
00:02:59,139 --> 00:03:00,659
In a way, nothing else could have.

35
00:03:00,659 --> 00:03:06,539
BlackRock's entrance into Bitcoin is significant, not just because of IBIT, but because of what they will do next.

36
00:03:06,539 --> 00:03:09,699
Integrating Bitcoin into their mutual fund complex.

37
00:03:09,699 --> 00:03:13,939
BlackRock manages trillions in target date funds for 401Ks.

38
00:03:13,939 --> 00:03:18,740
Adding even 1-2% Bitcoin allocation would create massive demand.

39
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:25,740
Investors might get Bitcoin exposure without explicitly knowing it, which is likely what it will take for mass adoption.

40
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:28,900
This is the ultimate Trojan horse.

41
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:35,180
BlackRock's mutual fund complex is the vehicle that finally brings institutional Bitcoin exposure to pensions and retirement accounts

42
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:37,460
by making it indirect and almost invisible.

43
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:49,819
BlackRock's research has suggested that a small allocation to Bitcoin, 1-5%, can significantly improve portfolio risk-adjusted returns due to Bitcoin's low correlation with traditional assets.

44
00:03:49,819 --> 00:03:54,659
With bonds no longer risk-free, portfolio construction must be rethought.

45
00:03:54,659 --> 00:03:58,460
Bitcoin offers low correlation to stocks and bonds.

46
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:01,300
Superior long-term returns historically.

47
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:07,900
Inflation hedge properties, 24-7 liquidity, and no counterparty risk in self-custody.

48
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:14,099
If there's no risk-free asset, where does Bitcoin belong in an investment portfolio?

49
00:04:14,099 --> 00:04:23,300
Bitcoin may be the new foundation, not risk-free, but with different risks than traditional assets and superior long-term returns.

50
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:26,180
Let's recap what we learned in this chapter.

51
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:34,379
LDI strategies failed spectacularly when rates reversed in 2022, requiring bank of England emergency intervention.

52
00:04:34,379 --> 00:04:37,500
Risk-free assets proved to be an illusion.

53
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:43,740
Government bonds lost 30-50% of value, shattering modern portfolio theory.

54
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:51,620
BlackRock pivoted dramatically from calling Bitcoin only useful to money-launders, to launching the largest Bitcoin ETF.

55
00:04:51,620 --> 00:05:02,500
IBIT broke every ETF record, fastest to $10,020,030,040,050,050,050 in assets under management.

56
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:09,579
The mutual fund integration will be the Trojan horse that brings Bitcoin to retirement accounts worldwide.

57
00:05:09,579 --> 00:05:12,660
This concludes Part 2.

58
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:16,220
In the next episode, we begin Part 3.

59
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:18,220
Institutional Bitcoin.

60
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:20,899
Starting with deferred compensation.

61
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:25,420
How executives can use NQDC plans to gain Bitcoin exposure.

62
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:26,500
See you in the next one.
