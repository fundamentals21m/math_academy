00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
A company that holds Bitcoin in its treasury has a significant optionality advantage over one that does not.

2
00:00:06,599 --> 00:00:10,400
We have covered the story of strategy, formerly micro-strategy,

3
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:15,000
solving their existential problem of how to protect their cash from government debasement.

4
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:23,199
That problem was so relatable that many individuals adopted that strategy for themselves to great success.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,000
So many people have started their own Bitcoin treasuries, but very few companies have followed suit.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,600
For the most part, only Bitcoin mining companies like Riot and Mara are holding Bitcoin in their treasury.

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,399
Most mining companies eventually sell off their treasury to pay employees or debt.

8
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:48,000
One of the large barriers for companies was that until 2024, FASB had no guidance for how to account for Bitcoin.

9
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:56,600
Under the old interpretation, the value of Bitcoin was held constant and written down when there was a drawdown, but never written back up.

10
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:02,000
This made it very difficult to explain to investors why they were holding Bitcoin.

11
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:12,599
If they never benefited from price increases, but always suffered from decreases, the accounting problem was fixed when FASB issued accounting standards update 2023-08.

12
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:21,400
This clarified the accounting treatment as a full mark to market approach, where the account value of Bitcoin would be carried and reported according to the prevailing market price.

13
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:30,799
Companies can now report their Bitcoin holdings at current market value, reflecting both gains and losses in real time.

14
00:01:31,599 --> 00:01:36,599
This is expected to pave the way for much more widespread Bitcoin treasury adoption.

15
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:40,599
Bitcoin can be uniquely used by companies to lower their operating costs.

16
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:50,400
This is of interest to CFOs and management teams because operating profitability is typically how they are judged by their boards and what their incentive compensation payouts depend on.

17
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:57,200
A company that holds Bitcoin in its treasury can either hold it and let it accumulate gains that investors will view as extraordinary.

18
00:01:57,599 --> 00:02:05,599
Or they can deploy that treasury by regularly selling a portion into rising markets and getting accountants to include those gains in operating revenue.

19
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:15,199
Assume a forward looking return of Bitcoin as an actuarial assumption. 30% or 40% a year is reasonable based on historical data.

20
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,599
Establish a clearly defined program that actually sells a certain amount of Bitcoin regularly.

21
00:02:21,199 --> 00:02:27,800
Classify a percentage of treasury gains as operating income instead of capital gains. Let me give you a real-world example.

22
00:02:28,199 --> 00:02:42,599
Consider a large Bitcoin mining company. With their current strategy, they have revenue of about $77 million and operating expenses of $88 million, a net operating loss of $11 million and a negative 15% margin.

23
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:55,800
With the proposed strategy, deploying just 16% of their Bitcoin treasury with a 35% assumed return, they lower their costs below their revenue and produce a positive net operating income.

24
00:02:56,599 --> 00:03:00,800
The company goes from a negative 15% margin to a positive margin.

25
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:10,199
If actual Bitcoin performance differs from 35%, the difference can be amortized outside of operating income below the line.

26
00:03:10,599 --> 00:03:18,400
This is not a corporate finance trick. It may appear that a company can use Bitcoin cosmetically to fool investors into thinking it's profitable when it isn't.

27
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:25,199
That is far from what is being suggested here. Bitcoin is money. The hardest money the world has ever seen.

28
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:36,599
Not a return bearing asset. It protects purchasing power from monetary debasement. It protects against censorship and confiscation.

29
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:48,199
It lowers costs over time relative to USD. And it has always increased over periods exceeding five years. There's no free lunch though. Bitcoin is scarce.

30
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:54,199
Deploying it incurs significant opportunity cost. You sacrifice long-term price potential.

31
00:03:54,599 --> 00:03:59,599
You sacrifice superior monetary properties. Let's recap what we learned in this chapter.

32
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:08,000
FastB ASU 2023-08 enables market to market accounting for Bitcoin, removing a major barrier to corporate adoption.

33
00:04:08,199 --> 00:04:15,199
Bitcoin Treasuries provide optionality. Companies can hold for appreciation or deploy to lower operating costs.

34
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:22,199
Operating profitability can be improved by systematically selling Bitcoin gains and including them in operating revenue.

35
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:30,800
This isn't accounting trickery. Bitcoin genuinely lowers costs over time because USD underperforms Bitcoin by design.

36
00:04:31,399 --> 00:04:39,199
But there is no free lunch. Deploying Bitcoin means sacrificing its long-term potential and superior monetary properties.

37
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:48,600
In the next episode, we'll explore structured credit. How Bitcoin as collateral is transforming the credit worthiness of loans. See you in the next one.
