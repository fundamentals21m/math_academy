1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,519
If a borrower posts Bitcoin as collateral, this loan would automatically become the most senior loan.

2
00:00:05,519 --> 00:00:10,240
A person will let any other asset go before relinquishing their Bitcoin to a lender.

3
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:13,919
Credit is one of the fundamental features of any high functioning society.

4
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:19,600
The ability to borrow and lend at a healthy equilibrium is what separates the highest

5
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:24,960
functioning economies from the lowest ones. Credit is built on trust and trustworthiness,

6
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:31,600
characterized by its own term. Creditworthiness. A hallmark of a society built on inflationary

7
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:37,280
money is that debt is ubiquitous. It makes sense to borrow money now, use it for something valuable,

8
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:41,920
and pay back your loan in the future with debased money. In a world without Bitcoin,

9
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:45,359
this is how people win in the Fiat game. You want to be a borrower.

10
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:51,600
The US government has issued close to $40 trillion in debt, far in excess of GDP.

11
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,759
There is zero likelihood of ever paying it back without significant dollar devaluation.

12
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:02,880
If we include unfunded liabilities, social security, Medicare, government pensions,

13
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:08,959
we're looking at over $200 trillion. Auto loans total $2 trillion.

14
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:15,040
Student loans, irrevocable and immune to bankruptcy. Another $2 trillion.

15
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:21,439
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Government-backed mortgage lending. $7 trillion.

16
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:26,000
The story of virtually every market crash going back to Sumeria involves collateral becoming

17
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:32,319
devalued significantly over a short period of time. In 2008, the global financial crisis,

18
00:01:32,319 --> 00:01:39,599
housing collateral plummeted. People walked away from underwater mortgages. In 2022, the Bank of England

19
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:47,439
pension bailout. UK GILTS rapidly devalued by Fed rate rises, triggering emergency intervention.

20
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:54,640
In 2023, the US banking crisis. Five major banks failed when US Treasuries were devalued by an

21
00:01:54,640 --> 00:02:01,439
unprecedented 5% rate rise. UK GILTS and US Treasuries were no longer reliable collateral.

22
00:02:02,239 --> 00:02:07,920
We seem to have reached the end of the line. Enter Bitcoin and a company called Battery Finance.

23
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:12,800
New market capital and their subsidiary, Battery Finance, have developed a loan product that

24
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:18,159
might possibly transform credit markets as we know them. Battery Finance enables Bitcoin to be

25
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:24,479
used as 10% to 30% of the collateral for loans alongside traditional assets. The key features.

26
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:31,360
Bitcoin's market price won't factor into the loan to value ratio for a fixed period. Minimum

27
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:37,759
four years. Aligned with Bitcoin's having cycle. Lender and borrower share in Bitcoin's

28
00:02:37,759 --> 00:02:43,280
appreciation over the loan life. Longer loan duration means greater share of appreciation for the

29
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:49,680
borrower. Using Bitcoin as collateral reduces the interest rate on the loan. And the loan can be

30
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:54,800
paid off at any time without penalty. The loan carries a single digit interest rate and has a

31
00:02:54,800 --> 00:03:00,080
maturity of 10 years. Credit markets operate around the concept of subordination, which loans get

32
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:04,879
paid off first if a borrower has multiple loans. This idea of seniority is about to be flipped

33
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:09,840
on its head by Battery Finance's loan product. If a borrower posts Bitcoin as collateral,

34
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:15,439
this loan would automatically become the most senior loan, not because of contractual priority,

35
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:21,199
but because of behavioral priority. A person will let any other asset go before relinquishing their

36
00:03:21,199 --> 00:03:28,080
Bitcoin to a lender. This behavioral reality, combined with accumulated Bitcoin gains over time,

37
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:32,560
means borrowers have extreme incentive to honor Bitcoin collateralized loans first.

38
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:37,759
After four years, there will almost certainly be significant gains at stake.

39
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:42,080
Default rates on these loans should approach triple A equivalent behavior.

40
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:47,439
Traditional subordination structures become inverted. There are two types of Bitcoin borrowers.

41
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:53,199
The Dagen accumulated Bitcoin through reckless borrowing. They're not afraid of debt or high yields.

42
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:58,240
They would be considered a terrible borrower by traditional lenders. They view themselves as

43
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:04,000
speculatively attacking the dollar. But they will absolutely prioritize the home loan if Bitcoin gains

44
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:10,000
are at stake. Battery can charge high yield with confidence they'll repay. The saver typically

45
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:16,079
doesn't like debt and avoids it. They're considered a good risk to traditional lenders. Their Bitcoin

46
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:21,759
is everything to them. They will go to the ends of the world to protect their stack. Using Bitcoin

47
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:28,319
as collateral will strongly impact their behavior. They should exhibit essentially triple A equivalent

48
00:04:28,319 --> 00:04:34,879
behavior. For bond portfolio managers, this creates a significant arbitrage opportunity,

49
00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:40,319
buying a package of batteries loans over a similarly rated package without Bitcoin as collateral.

50
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:47,920
Let's recap what we learned in this chapter. Traditional collateral has failed. The 2008, 2022,

51
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:54,800
and 2023 crises showed that housing, guilt, and treasuries can rapidly become unreliable.

52
00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:00,639
Battery Finance enables Bitcoin collateral without mark-to-market liquidation triggers.

53
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:07,199
Aligned with Bitcoin's four-year cycle. Bitcoin collateral redefines subordination.

54
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:11,920
Behaviorally, it becomes the most senior loan regardless of contractual priority.

55
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:18,079
Both degenz and savers will prioritize Bitcoin collateralized loans, creating potential

56
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:24,319
triple A equivalent credit quality. Credit markets will be transformed. What credit worthiness

57
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:31,360
actually means is being redefined by this innovation. In the next episode, we'll explore pensions.

58
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:35,920
How pension managers can use Bitcoin to pull the goalie and dramatically improve their odds of

59
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:45,920
meeting obligations. See you in the next one.
