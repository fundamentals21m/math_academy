1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
An important feature that makes it unintuitive for both individuals and institutions to integrate Bitcoin into their financial landscapes is its deflationary nature.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Bitcoin is the largest fixed supply asset on earth, programmed by its immutable protocol to cap out at 21 million whole units.

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
This creates a fundamental clash with how institutions think about money.

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:32,000
As of September 2025, Bitcoin had a market capitalization of over $2 trillion, making it the fifth largest asset in the world behind a handful of stocks and gold.

5
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Of the 21 million Bitcoin that will ever exist, 95% has already been issued.

6
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Current mining issuance is 3.1125 Bitcoin per block, roughly every 10 minutes.

7
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:52,000
That's about 450 Bitcoin per day, or approximately 165,000 Bitcoin per year.

8
00:00:52,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Bitcoin is already less inflationary than gold, which sees approximately 1.5% annual increase in supply.

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Bitcoin supply is currently inflating at roughly 0.8% half that rate.

10
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:15,000
This issuance will continue to have every 4 years until 21-40, after which there will be no new Bitcoin issued.

11
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:28,000
When inserted into a monetary landscape of vastly inflationary monies like Fiat currencies, stocks, bonds, and real estate, the supply-capped Bitcoin will continue to absorb the monetary energy of its peers.

12
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Why is deflation, or even the lack of inflation, a problem for institutions?

13
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Unlike annuity programs that provide for cost of living adjustments by increasing annual payments, participants on the Bitcoin network will generally follow its reward schedule and require lower amounts over time.

14
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Every accountant emphasizes present value as the common way to view streams of cash flows.

15
00:01:52,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Deflation is a foreign concept in this framework. Consider hidden debatement. US dollars are being devalued in purchasing power by inflationary forces.

16
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Even at 2-3% CPI, $1,000 in 10 years has a purchasing power of only about $800 today.

17
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Using present value as a benchmark, masks the debatement of expected future payoffs and colors the incentives of debt issuers.

18
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Traditional valuation methods hide the significant counterparty risk that comes with debt-based financial instruments.

19
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:33,000
The discussion becomes clear when one compares a future pay-off payable in Bitcoin with a future pay-off payable in US dollars.

20
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Consider a $1,000 payment in 10 years. Present value at 10% discount rate is about $375.

21
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
But that purchasing power is eroded by inflation.

22
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:52,000
The real value is significantly less than $375 and it's subject to further currency debatements.

23
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Now consider 0.01 Bitcoin in 10 years. It at least retains purchasing power.

24
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Three havings means it roughly doubles three times against the dollar.

25
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Expected future value, approximately $8,000 in today's purchasing power.

26
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:20,000
And there's no central issuer to debase it. It is unacceptable to view a Bitcoin pay-off today as worth anything less than its current dollar equivalent on an apples-to-apples basis with a Fiat-denominated bond.

27
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,000
These estimates assume no further currency debatements, which is a highly unreasonable assumption.

28
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:34,000
In order for individuals and institutions to utilize Bitcoin intelligently, they will need different optics from those they use today.

29
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Bitcoin's primary use case is to protect purchasing power. The contrast in purchasing power will require institutions to focus more on future value as opposed to present value.

30
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,000
This pivot will be much more intuitive for individuals to adopt than institutions.

31
00:03:51,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Institutions will need to understand the time and risk preferences of individuals and how Bitcoin is already reshaping them.

32
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:08,000
All companies need to understand the impact of Bitcoin on the value systems of individuals to continue offering competitive compensation to their employees.

33
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Once these dynamics are understood, we can begin to look at how institutions can use their balance sheets to offer financial services to either retail individuals or other institutions.

34
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:24,000
The key insight is this. Bitcoin flips the traditional financial model upside down.

35
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:32,000
In Fiat Finance, a promise to pay tomorrow is worth less than cash today because inflation erodes value.

36
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:40,000
In Bitcoin Finance, a promise to pay tomorrow may be worth more than Bitcoin today because deflation increases purchasing power.

37
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:49,000
This requires a complete rewiring of institutional thinking and that rewiring must start with understanding why individuals are already making this shift.

38
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Let's recap what we learned in this chapter.

39
00:04:52,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Bitcoin is the largest fixed supply asset on earth with 21 million units capped by a mutable protocol, 95% already issued.

40
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Bitcoin is already less inflationary than gold at approximately 0.8% annual supply increase, having every four years until 0% in 2140.

41
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Present Value Masks Debatement. Traditional Financial Valuation hides the erosion of purchasing power in Fiat currencies.

42
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Institutions must shift to future value thinking to properly understand Bitcoin's role in protecting purchasing power.

43
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Companies must understand Bitcoin's impact on individuals to offer competitive compensation and financial services.

44
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:36,000
In the next episode, we'll explore chapter 3.

45
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Bitcoin.

46
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Custody. Requires higher understanding.

47
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:47,000
We'll examine the complex trade-offs between security, accessibility, and control.

48
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
See you in the next one.
