00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,040
If you are a typical institution wanting to use Bitcoin, chances are that you are unfamiliar with

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:10,720
bearer assets. You may be wondering why you're even reading about them. A lot of the confusion that

3
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:16,160
exists around Bitcoin stems from the extraordinary property that it has of being a bearer asset.

4
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:22,559
This property is what makes Bitcoin fundamentally different from every other financial instrument.

5
00:00:22,559 --> 00:00:28,000
A bearer asset is a type of financial asset where ownership is determined by physical possession,

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,520
rather than by registration or the holder's identity. In the past, traditional bearer assets

7
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:39,600
included cash because back in the gold standard era, cash represented a claim on the central bank

8
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:45,600
gold reserve. The key characteristic of these assets was that whoever physically held cash

9
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:52,719
could claim the value it represented. However, in modern times, cash is no longer considered a bearer

10
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:58,479
asset because it no longer means a direct claim on gold or any other asset. Bitcoin can be viewed as

11
00:00:58,479 --> 00:01:03,759
a bearer asset due to its ownership model. Ownership of Bitcoin is established through the possession of

12
00:01:03,759 --> 00:01:09,280
private keys, which allow the holder to control and transfer the Bitcoin associated with a specific

13
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:15,840
address. Unlike traditional bearer assets, Bitcoin does not represent a claim on any other asset.

14
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:21,040
Instead, it is a digital asset directly owned and controlled by the key holder.

15
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:28,319
This digital form of bearer asset emphasizes the importance of securing private keys.

16
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:32,799
The key feature of a bearer asset is that its ownership is entirely determined by physical

17
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:38,159
possession. This property exists with other assets like gold and silver, but the cost of

18
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:43,840
custodying a bearer asset with a physical form is prohibitively expensive. Consider security costs.

19
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:49,519
Depending on how much you have, you might need a military to secure it. The value must justify

20
00:01:49,519 --> 00:01:56,159
the costs of defending it. Consider validation costs. Even if secured, it's extremely expensive

21
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:01,680
to prove its existence and authenticity. Gold bars need to be melted down and assayed.

22
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:07,439
Gold and silver bars must be verified to ensure they are not just gold-plated tungsten.

23
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:15,039
The one benefit. When legal structures break down in society, these assets don't require

24
00:02:15,039 --> 00:02:22,879
institutions to retain their value. Compare these three bearer assets. Gold and silver require

25
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:29,120
physical vaults, possibly military protection. Validation requires melting and assaying.

26
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:35,919
They're heavy and can be seized. Cash before 1971 could be stored in banks or safes.

27
00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:43,199
Validation was relatively easy. It represented a claim on gold. Bitcoin requires only a 1224

28
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:49,280
word seed phrase. Validation is trivial, just a digital signature. And unlimited value can be

29
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:55,120
stored in your mind. Banks were born to secure and validate gold. Prior to Nixon's closing of the

30
00:02:55,120 --> 00:03:00,560
gold window in 1971, cash was considered to be a bearer asset because it represented a claim

31
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:05,120
on gold owned by the central bank without the need to prove ownership outside of possession.

32
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:14,319
Cash was a technological breakthrough as a bearer asset because while it still required professional

33
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:20,319
protection at a high enough value, authenticity was typically not difficult or expensive to validate.

34
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:26,000
When cash could no longer be exchanged directly for gold, it lost its power as a bearer asset.

35
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:30,000
It put a significant friction between the paper and the gold it represented.

36
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:34,159
People didn't want to be holding a significant amount of it out of fear of their government,

37
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:39,599
placing further frictions on it. That leaves us with Bitcoin, a very special bearer asset.

38
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:44,719
It has all the benefits of frictionless proof of ownership and validation that reserve notes had

39
00:03:44,719 --> 00:03:50,719
over gold and much, much more. There is no risk of devaluation or frictions imposed by a central

40
00:03:50,719 --> 00:03:56,319
issuer because there is no central issuer. Bitcoin is created and issued by the protocol set in

41
00:03:56,319 --> 00:04:03,840
motion by Satoshi Nakamoto on January 3rd, 2009. It runs on a decentralized network of nodes.

42
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:09,280
Validating computers all over the world that run the open source Bitcoin software and contain a

43
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:15,360
record of every block ever issued and every transaction ever made. No node or even group of nodes has

44
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:21,839
the power to change the rules of the protocol, nor can they be exempted. Every node does its own

45
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:28,399
validation, but it is part of the larger network. A node that wants to run different rules is free

46
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:34,240
to do so, but they are unlikely to be able to spend their version of Bitcoin as other nodes will

47
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:40,160
not recognize their coins as valid. The cryptographic model behind Bitcoin is based on the fact that

48
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:45,519
private keys do not exist physically and are virtually impossible to guess, yet are incredibly

49
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:50,879
easy to validate. My great grandmother came to the US in the early 1900s from Ukraine at the age of

50
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:55,920
10, when she was put on a boat by herself with five diamond stones sewn into her pillowcase.

51
00:04:56,480 --> 00:05:02,079
The miraculous end of the story, somehow finding family and not being robbed, is one of the great

52
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:06,720
inspirations when thinking about what a special store of wealth Bitcoin private keys are.

53
00:05:07,439 --> 00:05:11,040
Imagine that those diamonds were bought with whatever money the family could muster.

54
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:17,519
Instead, they could have bought Bitcoin and stored them in a 12-word seed. My great grandmother

55
00:05:17,519 --> 00:05:22,879
could have just memorized the 12 words, maybe in a song, and never had the terrorizing thoughts of

56
00:05:22,879 --> 00:05:28,240
her family's life work being stolen. All she would have needed upon arrival is a phone with

57
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:34,399
internet access, and she could convert all of that Bitcoin into the local currency. Your Bitcoin

58
00:05:34,399 --> 00:05:40,720
cannot be stolen through violence. If you memorize a 12 or 24-word private key, you can store an

59
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:45,680
unlimited amount of wealth in your mind. Anyone who has been a refugee, experienced a bank run,

60
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:50,879
or crossed a border fearing seizure understands this power. Knowing one can just sell everything they

61
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:56,319
own and put it on a 12-word seed and go anywhere they want in the world is a level of individual

62
00:05:56,319 --> 00:06:01,360
sovereignty previously unavailable to human beings. Let's recap what we learned in this chapter.

63
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,279
Barer assets derive ownership from possession, whoever holds it owns it without requiring

64
00:06:07,279 --> 00:06:14,000
registration or identity. Bitcoin is the most powerful Barer asset ever created. Non-physical,

65
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:19,279
easy to validate, and impossible to seize without consent. Physical Barer assets have prohibitive

66
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:24,879
costs. Gold requires military-level security and expensive assaying for validation. Cash lost

67
00:06:24,879 --> 00:06:30,240
its Barer status in 1971 when Nixon closed the Gold window, breaking the direct link to gold.

68
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:37,120
Self-custody enables unprecedented sovereignty. Unlimited wealth stored in a 12-word seed phrase,

69
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:42,720
accessible anywhere on earth. Institutions must understand that the people they share the

70
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:49,680
bitning market with will place a significant premium on Barer ownership, and they are going to

71
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:54,560
apply a deep discount towards every layer of institutional ownership they have to yield this power to.

72
00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:04,800
In the next episode, we'll explore Chapter 6 Bitcoin user's value privacy. We'll examine why

73
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:10,720
privacy is fundamental to Bitcoin's value proposition, and why institutions struggle with this concept.

74
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:19,600
See you in the next one.
