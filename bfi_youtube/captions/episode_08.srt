1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
He described Bitcoin as a dependable store of value and an attractive investment asset with more long-term appreciation potential than holding cash.

2
00:00:08,599 --> 00:00:12,000
That was Micro Strategies Press release in August 2020.

3
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:19,199
Today, the company, now simply called Strategy, holds over 500,000 Bitcoin.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,300
This is the one success story of an institution doing corporate Bitcoin right.

5
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,300
And it took one individual to make it happen.

6
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:30,100
Michael Sailor is the founder and chairman of Strategy.

7
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:36,100
He is an MIT trained engineer who founded the company with a $250,000 grant from Dupont.

8
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:40,600
He would seem to be the unlikliest of characters to lead the world in buying Bitcoin.

9
00:00:41,299 --> 00:00:49,140
As an engineer, Sailor explained the properties of Bitcoin from an engineering perspective in a way that is likely responsible for leveling up the understanding of Bitcoin from

10
00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:53,299
Magic Internet money to thermodynamically sound digital real estate.

11
00:00:53,299 --> 00:01:00,399
This reframing was crucial. Bitcoin wasn't just code. It was digital energy, crystallized and preserved across time.

12
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,100
Sailor's worldview was simple.

13
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:10,099
He had a $250,000,000 pile of cash in 2020 and was looking at an epic monetary debasement of Western fiat currencies.

14
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:17,099
The US was on its way to printing $7,000,000 over an M2 monetary base of $15,000,000.

15
00:01:17,599 --> 00:01:21,400
That's nearly a 50% expansion of the money supply in a short period.

16
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:29,599
Western cash holders were caught off guard, lulled into complacency by 15 years of gaslighting about how printing money isn't inflationary.

17
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:31,500
Sailor drew the line.

18
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:37,000
He refused to allow the US government to debase his company's cash and cash equivalents.

19
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:44,299
In August 2020, he converted $250,000,000 into approximately $21,000 Bitcoin.

20
00:01:45,099 --> 00:01:47,299
The rest is monetary history.

21
00:01:47,599 --> 00:01:50,799
Strategies Bitcoin accumulation followed an aggressive pattern.

22
00:01:51,400 --> 00:02:01,799
In 2020-2021, they accumulated approximately $125,000 Bitcoin, buying at prices ranging from $10,000 to $60,000.

23
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:13,500
Through the 2022-2023 bear market, they continued buying, reaching approximately $190,000 Bitcoin at prices between $16,000 and $30,000.

24
00:02:14,099 --> 00:02:26,400
In 2024-2025, they pioneered the use of convertible debt to accelerate purchases, now holding over $500,000 Bitcoin at prices ranging from $60,000 to $100,000.

25
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:32,900
Strategies market capitalization has grown from approximately $1 billion to nearly $100 billion.

26
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:39,699
Driven primarily by their Bitcoin holdings, they await S&P 500 entry despite meeting the criteria.

27
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:44,500
Tesla also put Bitcoin on their balance sheet in 2020, led by Elon Musk.

28
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:47,400
However, the outcomes were dramatically different.

29
00:02:47,699 --> 00:02:50,300
Strategy continued accumulating aggressively.

30
00:02:50,699 --> 00:02:52,599
They never sold during downturns.

31
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:55,599
They transformed their company identity around Bitcoin.

32
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,699
Their market cap grew from $1 billion to nearly $100 billion.

33
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:03,699
Tesla initially purchased Bitcoin for treasury.

34
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,800
They exited their position shortly after S&P 500 inclusion.

35
00:03:08,199 --> 00:03:10,400
Bitcoin was peripheral to their business.

36
00:03:10,699 --> 00:03:13,400
Institutional pressure forced the exit.

37
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,199
This validates exactly what Chapter 1 predicted.

38
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:20,900
Institutional pressure will eventually force selling.

39
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:24,900
Only a dominant individual like sailor can resist this pressure.

40
00:03:25,099 --> 00:03:28,900
Strategy pioneered the use of convertible debt to acquire more Bitcoin.

41
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:33,599
This allows them to borrow at low interest rates and use the proceeds to buy Bitcoin.

42
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,400
Betting that Bitcoin's appreciation will exceed the cost of borrowing.

43
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:44,400
Convertible bonds often have near zero coupon rates because investors want exposure to potential equity upside.

44
00:03:45,099 --> 00:03:49,900
If Bitcoin appreciates 30% or more annually, as history suggests,

45
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,199
the cost of borrowing is negligible by comparison.

46
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:57,199
If the bonds convert to equity, shareholders are deluded.

47
00:03:57,699 --> 00:04:00,599
But the Bitcoin holdings have grown proportionally more.

48
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:05,199
Strategy has turned corporate finance into a Bitcoin accumulation vehicle

49
00:04:05,199 --> 00:04:07,099
that other companies are beginning to copy.

50
00:04:07,099 --> 00:04:09,400
Let's recap what we learned in this chapter.

51
00:04:09,699 --> 00:04:11,599
Strategy proves it can be done.

52
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:15,000
A public company can successfully hold Bitcoin long term,

53
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,199
but it requires a dominant individual.

54
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:20,399
Sailors engineering mindset elevated Bitcoin from

55
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:25,199
magic internet money to thermodynamically sound digital real estate.

56
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:28,000
Tesla's exit validates the theory.

57
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:32,399
Without a dominant individual, institutional pressure will force selling.

58
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,300
Cash is a melting ice cube.

59
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,100
The new paradigm views Bitcoin as superior to cash for corporate treasuries.

60
00:04:40,699 --> 00:04:47,199
Convertible debt enables leverage strategy pioneered using corporate finance to accelerate Bitcoin accumulation.

61
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:50,399
In the next episode, we'll explore BlackRock.

62
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:55,600
How Larry Fink went from calling Bitcoin only useful to money launders,

63
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,199
to launching the most successful ETF in history.

64
00:04:59,899 --> 00:05:01,100
See you in the next one.
