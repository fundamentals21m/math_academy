    type: 'multiple-choice',
    question: 'How does MP3 compression work?',
    options: [
      'By removing all high notes',
      'By using Fourier transforms to identify frequencies we can\\'t hear and discarding them',

      'By converting to a different file format',
    ],
    correctIndex: 1,
    difficulty: 'medium',
    explanation: 'MP3 uses Fourier analysis to identify frequency components our ears can\'t detect, then removes them to reduce file size.',
