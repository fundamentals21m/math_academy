    question: 'What is the basic idea of a Riemann sum?',
    options: [
      'Approximating area under a curve using rectangles',
      'Adding two numbers',
      'Finding the slope of a curve',
      'Dividing a number into prime factors',
    ],
    correctIndex: 0,
    difficulty: 'easy',
    explanation: 'Riemann sums approximate the area under a curve by dividing the region into thin rectangles and adding up their areas.',
  },

    type: 'text',
    question: 'What ancient mathematician developed the "method of exhaustion" to find areas of curved regions?',
    correctAnswer: 'Archimedes',
    difficulty: 'medium',
    explanation: 'Archimedes used the method of exhaustion around 250 BCE to find areas like that of a parabolic segment, approximating with polygons.',

    id: 3,
    type: 'multiple-choice',
    question: 'What happens to a Riemann sum as the number of rectangles increases?',
    options: [
      'It becomes less accurate',
      'It becomes infinite',
      'It stays the same',
      'It approaches the exact area (the integral)',
    ],
    correctIndex: 3,
    difficulty: 'easy',
    explanation: 'As we use more and thinner rectangles, the Riemann sum gets closer to the true area. The limit of this process is the definite integral.',
  },

    type: 'numeric',
    question: 'What is the value of $\\int_0^1 x^2 \\, dx$?',
    correctAnswer: 0.33,
    numericRange: { min: 0, max: 1, precision: 2 },
    difficulty: 'medium',
    explanation: 'The integral of $x^2$ from 0 to 1 equals $\\frac{x^3}{3}\\big|_0^1 = \\frac{1}{3} \\approx 0.33$.',

    difficulty: 'easy',
    explanation: 'Leibniz designed $\\int$ as an elongated S for "summa" (sum), representing the sum of infinitely many infinitesimal pieces.',

    id: 6,
    type: 'multiple-choice',
    question: 'When the function $f(x)$ is negative, what does the integral compute?',
    options: [
      'The same positive area',
      'Signed (negative) area—below the x-axis counts as negative',
      'Zero',
      'The integral is undefined',
    ],
    correctIndex: 1,
    difficulty: 'medium',
    explanation: 'Integrals compute signed area: positive above the x-axis, negative below. This allows increases and decreases to cancel when computing net change.',
