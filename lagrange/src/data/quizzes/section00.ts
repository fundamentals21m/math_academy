    question: 'The Lagrangian $L$ of a mechanical system is defined as:',
    options: [
      '$L = T - V$ (kinetic minus potential energy)',
      '$L = T + V$ (kinetic plus potential energy)',
      '$L = T \\times V$ (kinetic times potential energy)',
      '$L = V - T$ (potential minus kinetic energy)',
    ],
    correctIndex: 0,
    difficulty: 'easy',
    explanation: 'The Lagrangian is defined as $L = T - V$, where $T$ is kinetic energy and $V$ is potential energy. This definition leads to equations of motion that are equivalent to Newton\'s laws.',

    question: 'The Euler-Lagrange equation is:',
    options: [
      '$\\frac{d}{dt}\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{q}} - \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial q} = 0$',
      '$\\frac{d}{dt}\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial q} - \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{q}} = 0$',

    ],
    correctIndex: 0,
    difficulty: 'medium',
    explanation: 'The Euler-Lagrange equation $\\frac{d}{dt}\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{q}} - \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial q} = 0$ is the fundamental equation of Lagrangian mechanics, derived from the principle of stationary action.',

    question: 'For a simple pendulum of length $\\ell$ and mass $m$, what is the correct Lagrangian?',
    options: [
      '$L = \\frac{1}{2}m\\ell^2\\dot{\\theta}^2 + mg\\ell\\cos\\theta$',
      '$L = \\frac{1}{2}m\\ell^2\\dot{\\theta}^2 - mg\\ell\\cos\\theta$',

      '$L = m\\ell^2\\dot{\\theta}^2 - mg\\ell\\cos\\theta$',
    ],
    correctIndex: 0,
    difficulty: 'medium',
    explanation: 'For a pendulum, $T = \\frac{1}{2}m(\\ell\\dot{\\theta})^2 = \\frac{1}{2}m\\ell^2\\dot{\\theta}^2$ and $V = -mg\\ell\\cos\\theta$ (taking the lowest point as reference). Thus $L = T - V = \\frac{1}{2}m\\ell^2\\dot{\\theta}^2 + mg\\ell\\cos\\theta$.',

    question: 'What is the name of the quantity $p = \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{q}}$ called?',
    correctAnswer: 'conjugate momentum',
    difficulty: 'easy',
    explanation: 'The quantity $p = \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{q}}$ is called the conjugate momentum (or canonical momentum, generalized momentum). It is "conjugate" to the generalized coordinate $q$.',

    question: 'For a free particle with Lagrangian $L = \\frac{1}{2}m\\dot{x}^2$, what is the value of $\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial x}$?',
    correctAnswer: 0,
    numericRange: { min: -10, max: 10, precision: 0 },
    difficulty: 'easy',
    explanation: 'Since $L = \\frac{1}{2}m\\dot{x}^2$ contains no $x$ (only $\\dot{x}$), we have $\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial x} = 0$. This means the coordinate $x$ is cyclic, and momentum is conserved.',

    question: 'What principle underlies the derivation of the Euler-Lagrange equations?',
    options: [
      'The principle of stationary action (Hamilton\'s principle)',

      'Conservation of energy',
      'The principle of virtual work',
    ],
    correctIndex: 0,
    difficulty: 'medium',
    explanation: 'The Euler-Lagrange equations are derived from Hamilton\'s principle (principle of stationary action), which states that the physical path between two points makes the action $S = \\int L \\, dt$ stationary.',
