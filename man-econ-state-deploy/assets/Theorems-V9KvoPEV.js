      The axiom is self-evidently true and cannot be denied without self-refutation.

      To argue against human action, one must:
      1. Have a goal (refuting the axiom)
      2. Employ means (constructing arguments)
      3. Believe the means will achieve the goal

      This is itself purposeful action, confirming the axiom.

      1. An actor ranks ends from most to least urgent.
      2. Each unit of a good is applied to satisfy the next most urgent end.
      3. Therefore, each additional unit satisfies a less urgent end.

      If time preference were zero or negative, one would never consume—always deferring to the future.

      Therefore, time preference must be positive: present goods are valued more than future goods.

      1. In barter, some goods are more marketable (widely desired, easily traded) than others.
