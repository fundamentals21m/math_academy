    question: 'A tournament is:',

      'A complete bipartite graph with orientation',
      'An orientation of a complete graph',
      'A directed cycle',
      'A directed tree',

    question: 'In any digraph $D$, the sum of all in-degrees equals:',
    options: [
      'Both the number of arcs and the sum of out-degrees',
      'The number of vertices',
      'The sum of all out-degrees',
      'The number of arcs',
    ],
    correctIndex: 0,
    difficulty: 'medium',
    explanation: 'Each arc contributes 1 to exactly one in-degree and one out-degree, so $\\sum d^-(v) = \\sum d^+(v) = |A|$.',

    question: 'A digraph is strongly connected if:',

    correctAnswer: 10,
    numericRange: { min: 0, max: 50, precision: 0 },
    difficulty: 'hard',
    explanation: 'A tournament orients $K_n$, which has $\\binom{n}{2}$ edges. So a tournament on 5 vertices has $\\binom{5}{2} = 10$ arcs.',
