    question: 'An inscribed angle is an angle whose vertex lies on:',
    options: [
      'The center of the circle',
      'On a diameter',
      'Outside the circle',
      'The circumference of the circle',
    ],

    question: 'The inscribed angle theorem states: an inscribed angle is ____ the central angle subtending the same arc.',
    options: [
      'Twice',
      'Half of',
      'Equal to',
      'Unrelated to',
    ],
    correctIndex: 1,

    question: 'Thales\' circle theorem says: an angle inscribed in a semicircle is:',
    options: [
      'Acute',
      'Variable',
      'Obtuse',
      'A right angle (90°)',
    ],
    correctIndex: 3,
    difficulty: 'medium',
    explanation: 'The diameter subtends a central angle of 180°, so the inscribed angle is 90°.',
