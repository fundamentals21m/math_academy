      'A unit length segment',
      'Numerical coordinates',

      'A calculator',
      'Similar triangles and parallel lines',

      'A rational number m/n',
      'A natural number',
      'Negative',
      'Irrational (not a ratio of integers)',

    difficulty: 'hard',
    explanation: 'Greeks interpreted ab as the area of a rectangle, not a length. Descartes later changed this.',
