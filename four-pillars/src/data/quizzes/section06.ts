    question: 'Euclid\'s fifth postulate (parallel axiom) describes when two lines:',
    options: [
      'Are perpendicular',
      'Form a triangle',
      'Have equal length',
      'Meet (are not parallel)',
    ],
    correctIndex: 3,
    difficulty: 'easy',
    explanation: 'The axiom states that if interior angles sum to less than π, the lines meet on that side.',
  },

    id: 2,
    type: 'multiple-choice',
    question: 'Playfair\'s axiom says: given a line L and point P not on L, there is:',
    options: [
      'Infinitely many lines through P parallel to L',
      'Exactly one line through P parallel to L',
      'No line through P parallel to L',
      'Exactly two lines through P parallel to L',
    ],
    correctIndex: 1,
    difficulty: 'easy',
    explanation: 'This modern form of the parallel axiom is equivalent to Euclid\'s fifth postulate.',

    id: 3,
    type: 'multiple-choice',
    question: 'When a transversal crosses two parallel lines, the alternate interior angles are:',
    options: [
      'Equal',
      'Supplementary (sum to π)',
      'Unrelated',
      'Complementary (sum to π/2)',
    ],
    correctIndex: 0,
    difficulty: 'medium',
    explanation: 'This follows from the parallel axiom and is used to prove the triangle angle sum theorem.',
  },
  {
    id: 4,
    type: 'multiple-choice',
    question: 'The sum of angles in any triangle equals:',
    options: [
      '2π (360°)',
      'π/2 (90°)',
      'It varies by triangle',
      'π (180°)',
    ],
    correctIndex: 3,
    difficulty: 'medium',
    explanation: 'By drawing a parallel through one vertex, alternate interior angles show α + β + γ = π.',
  },

    id: 5,
    type: 'multiple-choice',
    question: 'An exterior angle of a triangle equals:',
    options: [
      'The sum of the two non-adjacent interior angles',
      'The adjacent interior angle',
      'The largest interior angle',
      'Half the sum of all interior angles',
    ],
    correctIndex: 0,
    difficulty: 'hard',
    explanation: 'If the exterior angle at C is δ and interior angles are α, β, γ, then δ = α + β.',

    type: 'multiple-choice',
    question: 'In non-Euclidean geometry (e.g., spherical), the angle sum of a triangle is:',
    options: [
      'Less than π',
      'Always π',
      'Greater than π',
      'Undefined',
    ],
    correctIndex: 2,
    difficulty: 'hard',
    explanation: 'On a sphere, triangle angle sums exceed π. The parallel axiom distinguishes Euclidean geometry.',
