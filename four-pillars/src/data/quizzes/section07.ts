      'They have the same area',
      'Their perimeters are equal',
      'One can be moved to coincide exactly with the other',
      'They have the same number of sides',

    question: 'The SAS congruence condition requires:',
    options: [
      'Two angles and one side equal',
      'Three sides equal',
      'All three angles equal',
      'Two sides and the included angle equal',

    question: 'In modern treatments, SAS is:',
    options: [
      'Proved from more basic axioms',
      'Not needed',
      'Taken as an axiom',
      'Derived from ASA',
    ],
    correctIndex: 2,
    difficulty: 'medium',
    explanation: 'Euclid\'s "superposition" proof is logically problematic; SAS is now taken as an axiom.',

    type: 'multiple-choice',
    question: 'The isosceles triangle theorem states: if AB = AC, then:',
    options: [
      'BC = AB',
      '∠ABC = ∠ACB',
      '∠BAC = 90°',
      'The triangle is equilateral',
