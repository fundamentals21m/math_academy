      'Two circles centered at A and B with radius AB',
      'A protractor to measure 60° angles',
      'Parallel lines',
      'A single circle centered at the midpoint',

    question: 'Why are all three sides of the constructed triangle equal?',
    options: [
      'CA and CB are radii of circles with radius AB',
      'The circles are congruent',
      'Because we used a ruler to measure',
