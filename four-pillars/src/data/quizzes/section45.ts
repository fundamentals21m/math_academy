      'The Pappus theorem',
      'The Pythagorean theorem',
      'The scissors theorem (from Desargues)',
      'Direct calculation',

    correctIndex: 2,
    difficulty: 'easy',
    explanation: 'The scissors theorem, which follows from Desargues, implies the associative law of addition.',

      'Hilbert',
      'Hausdorff',
      'Hamilton',

    question: 'The associative law of addition needs only the little scissors theorem because:',
    options: [
      'Addition is undefined for large numbers',
      'The scissors lie between parallel lines',
      'Subtraction is involved',
      'Addition is commutative',
    ],
    correctIndex: 1,
    difficulty: 'medium',
    explanation: 'For addition, the scissors lie between parallel lines, so only little Desargues is needed.',

    type: 'multiple-choice',
    question: 'The associative law of multiplication requires the full Desargues theorem because:',
    options: [
      'Multiplication is not commutative',
      'The scissors lie between the x- and y-axes (non-parallel)',
      'Multiplication involves the origin',
      'Division is involved',
