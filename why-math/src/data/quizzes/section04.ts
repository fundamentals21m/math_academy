    question: 'One repairman has worked 5 years longer than another. Together they have 23 years of experience. How many years has the newer repairman worked?',
    correctAnswer: 9,
    numericRange: { min: 0, max: 50, precision: 0 },
    difficulty: 'medium',
    explanation: 'Let $x$ = newer. Then $x + (x+5) = 23$, so $2x + 5 = 23$, $2x = 18$, $x = 9$.',

    question: 'The fundamental distance-rate-time formula is:',
    options: [
      'Distance = Rate + Time',
      'Distance = Rate × Time',
      'Distance = Rate / Time',
      'Distance = Rate - Time',

    question: 'A radiator has 12 quarts of 20% antifreeze. How many quarts of pure antifreeze must be added to get a 50% solution?',
    correctAnswer: 7.2,
    numericRange: { min: 0, max: 20, precision: 1 },
    difficulty: 'hard',
    explanation: 'Initial antifreeze: 2.4 qt. $\\frac{2.4 + x}{12 + x} = 0.50$. Solving: $2.4 + x = 6 + 0.5x$, so $0.5x = 3.6$, $x = 7.2$.',

    correctAnswer: -40,
    numericRange: { min: -100, max: 100, precision: 0 },
    difficulty: 'medium',
    explanation: 'Set $C = F$ in $F = \\frac{9}{5}C + 32$: $C = \\frac{9}{5}C + 32$, so $-\\frac{4}{5}C = 32$, $C = -40$.',

    numericRange: { min: 0, max: 20, precision: 0 },
    difficulty: 'medium',
    explanation: '$120 \\times 6 = 90 \\times x$. So $x = \\frac{720}{90} = 8$ feet.',
