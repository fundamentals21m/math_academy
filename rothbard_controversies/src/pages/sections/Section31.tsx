      <h2>A Reply to Georgist Criticisms</h2>

      <p>
        The followers of Henry George—known as Georgists—continue to advocate for the Single Tax
        on land values. They have responded to critics with various arguments, some sophisticated,
        some not. This section addresses the main Georgist criticisms and defends the position that
        land is legitimate property deserving the same protection as other assets.
      </p>

      <Callout type="info">
        <strong>The Continuing Debate:</strong> Although Henry George died over a century ago, his
        ideas retain a dedicated following. Georgist organizations continue to publish, educate,
        and advocate. Their persistence testifies to the appeal of George's vision, even as it
        requires ongoing response.

      <h3>The "Land Is Different" Argument</h3>
      <p>
        The central Georgist argument is that land is fundamentally different from other property.
        Land was not created by human effort; its supply is fixed; and its value derives largely
        from community development. These differences, Georgists argue, justify treating land
        differently for tax purposes.
      </p>

      <p>
        But these differences do not establish that land should be taxed away. Many things are not
        created by human effort—natural talents, for example—yet we do not tax them. The fixed
        supply of land is not unique; many resources are scarce. And the community contribution to
        land value is matched by community contributions to the value of all property through
        infrastructure, education, and legal institutions.
      </p>

      <Callout type="warning">
        <strong>The Slippery Slope:</strong> If "unearned" value can be taxed away, why stop at
        land? The value of stocks depends on community factors; should capital gains be confiscated?
        The value of labor depends on education and infrastructure; should wages be taxed at 100%?
        The principle of taxing "unearned" value has no natural stopping point.
      </Callout>

      <h3>The "Common Heritage" Argument</h3>
      <p>
        Georgists often invoke the idea that land is the "common heritage of mankind." Since no
        one created land, no one can have a legitimate claim to exclusive ownership. The community
        as a whole has the only valid claim to land values.
      </p>

      <p>
        This argument proves too much. If land belongs to everyone because no one created it, then
        no one can exclude anyone from using any land. But some exclusion is necessary for any
        productive use. The Georgist position does not eliminate private control of land; it merely
        transfers the benefits of that control from owners to government.
      </p>

      <h3>The Lockean Defense of Land Ownership</h3>
      <p>
        The Lockean theory of property provides a principled defense of land ownership. According
        to Locke, individuals acquire property by mixing their labor with unowned resources. The
        first person to clear, cultivate, and improve wild land makes it his own by his effort.
      </p>

      <Callout type="success">
        <strong>Original Appropriation:</strong> Land ownership originates in original appropriation
        and is validated by subsequent transfer. If the original appropriation was just—if the
        appropriator left "enough and as good" for others—then current owners have legitimate title,
        traceable through a chain of voluntary transfers.
      </Callout>

      <h3>The Transition Problem Revisited</h3>
      <p>
        Georgists often minimize the transition problem—the massive losses that would be imposed
        on current landowners by implementing the Single Tax. They argue that these losses are
        merely the return of ill-gotten gains, or that they can be phased in gradually.
      </p>

      <p>
        But current landowners bought their property at prices reflecting the existing system.
        They had every reason to expect that their property rights would be respected. Retroactively
        confiscating their property through taxation is a form of theft, regardless of what
        happened generations ago.
      </p>

      <h3>The Revenue Question</h3>
      <p>
        A practical objection to the Single Tax is that land values may not yield sufficient
        revenue to fund government. Georgists dispute this, claiming that land values are much
        higher than commonly supposed and that proper assessment would reveal their full extent.
      </p>

      <Callout type="info">
        <strong>The Empirical Dispute:</strong> The dispute over the revenue adequacy of land
        taxation is empirical, and the evidence is contested. But even if land taxes could fund
        current government spending, the relevant question is whether they should. A libertarian
        would prefer reduced spending to increased taxation of any kind.
      </Callout>

      <h3>Improvements and Land Value</h3>
      <p>
        A technical problem with the Single Tax is separating land value from improvement value.
        Georgists claim this can be done through sophisticated assessment techniques. But in
        practice, most land is improved, and the value of improvements cannot be neatly separated
        from the value of the underlying land.
      </p>

      <p>
        Moreover, landowners make decisions that affect land value—maintenance, development, and
        use decisions. A 100% tax on land value would remove the incentive to make these decisions
        wisely. The supposedly neutral land tax is not neutral after all.
      </p>

      <h3>Conclusion: Defending Land Rights</h3>
      <p>
        The Georgist critique of land ownership does not succeed. Land is property like any other,
        legitimately acquired through appropriation and transfer. The fact that no one created
        land does not establish that the community owns it. And the practical difficulties of
        implementing the Single Tax are formidable.
      </p>

      <Callout type="success">
        <strong>The Final Word:</strong> Property rights in land are essential to a free society.
        Without secure title to land, individuals cannot plan for the future, invest in improvements,
        or build lasting institutions. The Georgist attack on land ownership, however well-intentioned,
        threatens the foundations of liberty.
