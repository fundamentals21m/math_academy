      <h2>The Mantle of Science</h2>

      <p>
        In our proper condemnation of scientism in the study of man, we should not make the mistake
        of dismissing science as well. For if we do so, we credit scientism too highly and accept
        at face value its claim to be the one and only scientific method. If scientism is, as we
        believe it to be, an improper method, then it cannot be truly scientific. Science, after all,
        means <em>scientia</em>, correct knowledge; it is older and wiser than the positivist-pragmatist
        attempt to monopolize the term.
      </p>

      <Callout type="info">
        <strong>Definition:</strong> Scientism is the profoundly unscientific attempt to transfer
        uncritically the methodology of the physical sciences to the study of human action.
      </Callout>

      <p>
        Both fields of inquiry must be studied by the use of reason—the mind's identification of reality.
        But then it becomes crucially important, in reason, not to neglect the critical attribute of
        human action: that, alone in nature, human beings possess a rational consciousness. Stones,
        molecules, planets cannot choose their courses; their behavior is strictly and mechanically
        determined for them. Only human beings possess free will and consciousness: for they are
        conscious, and they can, and indeed must, choose their course of action.
      </p>

      <h3>The Sciences of Man</h3>
      <p>
        Man's necessity to choose means that, at any given time, he is acting to bring about some end
        in the immediate or distant future, that is, that he has purposes. The steps that he takes to
        achieve his ends are his means. Man is born with no innate knowledge of what ends to choose
        or how to use which means to attain them.
      </p>

      <Callout type="success">
        <strong>The Foundation:</strong> On the formal fact that man uses means to attain ends we ground
        the science of praxeology, or economics; psychology is the study of how and why man chooses the
        contents of his ends; technology tells what concrete means will lead to various ends; and ethics
        employs all the data of the various sciences to guide man toward the ends he should seek to attain.
      </Callout>

      <h3>The Problem of Free Will</h3>
      <p>
        It is curious that the determinist dogma has so often been accepted as the uniquely scientific
        position. In the first place, each human being knows universally from introspection that he
        chooses. The positivists and behaviorists may scoff at introspection all they wish, but it
        remains true that the introspective knowledge of a conscious man that he is conscious and
        acts is a fact of reality.
      </p>

      <p>
        Why, indeed, should we accept determinism in nature? The reason we say that things are determined
        is that every existing thing must have a specific existence. Having a specific existence, it must
        have certain definite, definable, delimitable attributes—every thing must have a specific nature.
        Every being, then, can act or behave only in accordance with its nature.
      </p>

      <Callout type="warning">
        <strong>The Self-Contradiction of Determinism:</strong> If we are determined in the ideas we
        accept, then X, the determinist, is determined to believe in determinism, while Y, the believer
        in free will, is also determined to believe in his own doctrine. Since man's mind is, according
        to determinism, not free to think and come to conclusions about reality, it is absurd for X
        to try to convince Y or anyone else of the truth of determinism.
      </Callout>

      <p>
        The determinist must rely, for the spread of his ideas, on the nondetermined, free-will choices
        of others, on their free will to adopt or reject ideas. In short, the determinist, to advocate
        his doctrine, must place himself and his theory outside the allegedly universally determined
        realm—that is, he must employ free will.
      </p>

      <h3>Ideas and Institutions</h3>
      <p>
        Since men are free to adopt ideas and to act upon them, it is never events or stimuli external
        to the mind that cause its ideas; rather the mind freely adopts ideas about external events.
        A savage, an infant, and a civilized man will each react in entirely different ways to the
        sight of the same stimulus—be it a fountain pen, an alarm clock, or a machine gun—for each
        mind has different ideas about the object's meaning and qualities.
      </p>

      <Callout type="info">
        <strong>Key Principle:</strong> Let us never say that the Great Depression of the 1930s
        <em>caused</em> men to adopt socialism or interventionism. The depression existed, and men
        were moved to think about this striking event; but that they adopted socialism as the way
        out was not determined by the event—they might just as well have chosen laissez-faire or
        any other attempted solution. The deciding factor was the idea that people chose to adopt.
      </Callout>

      <p>
        The realization that ideas, freely adopted, determine social institutions, and not vice versa,
        illuminates many critical areas of the study of man. Rousseau and his modern followers, who hold
        that man is good but corrupted by his institutions, must finally wither under the query: And who
        but men created these institutions?
      </p>

      <h3>False Mechanical Analogies of Scientism</h3>
      <p>
        The scientistic method in the study of man is almost wholly one of building on analogies from
        the physical sciences. Consider some of the common mechanistic analogies:
      </p>

      <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-dark-300 mb-6 space-y-2">
        <li><strong>Man as Servomechanism:</strong> Machines are devices made by man to serve man's purposes; their actions are preset by their creators. If men are machines, who created men and for what purpose?</li>
        <li><strong>Social Engineering:</strong> This term implies that men are no different from stones or other physical objects, to be blueprinted and reshaped by "social" engineers.</li>
        <li><strong>Model-Building:</strong> An engineering model is an exact replica in miniature; but economic "models" are simply a few equations that could only approximate a few of the numerous relations in the economy.</li>
        <li><strong>Measurement:</strong> The frantic attempts to measure intensive psychic magnitudes overlook that measurement implies the necessity for an objective extensive unit to serve as a measure.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>False Organismic Analogies</h3>
      <p>
        The organismic analogies attribute consciousness, or other organic qualities, to "social wholes"
        which are really only labels for the interrelations of individuals. Note such phrases as:
        "Society determines the values of its individual members"; or "The individual's actions are
        determined by the role he plays in the group."
      </p>

      <Callout type="warning">
        <strong>The Organismic Fallacy:</strong> Such concepts as "the public good," "the common good,"
        "social welfare" rest on the implicit premise that there exists a living organic entity known
        as "society" that has values and pursues ends. These concepts should be discarded as grossly
        unscientific. The next time someone preaches the priority of "public good" over individual good,
        we must ask: Who is the "public" in this case?
      </Callout>

      <h3>Axioms and Deduction</h3>
      <p>
        The fundamental axiom for the study of man is the existence of individual consciousness. On
        the formal fact that man uses means to attain ends we ground the science of praxeology. Professor
        Mises has shown that the entire structure of economic thought can be deduced from this axiom.
      </p>

      <p>
        Since the fundamental axioms are qualitative by nature, it follows that the propositions deduced
        by the laws of logic from these axioms are also qualitative. The laws of human action are therefore
        qualitative, and free will precludes quantitative laws. We may set forth the absolute economic law
        that an increase in the supply of a good, given the demand, will lower its price; but if we
        attempted to prescribe how much the price would fall given a definite increase in supply, we
        would shatter against the free-will rock of varying valuations by different individuals.
      </p>

      <Callout type="success">
        <strong>Conclusion:</strong> The true science of man bases itself upon the existence of individual
        human beings, upon individual life and consciousness. The scientistic approach, in contrast,
        always ranges against the meaningful existence of individuals. With such radically contrasting
        epistemologies, it is hardly coincidence that the political views of the two opposing camps
        tend to be individualist and collectivist, respectively.
