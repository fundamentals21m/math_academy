      <h2>Mercantilism: A Lesson for Our Times?</h2>

      <p>
        Mercantilism was the dominant economic doctrine of Europe from the sixteenth to the
        eighteenth century. It held that national wealth consisted of gold and silver; that a
        favorable balance of trade (exports exceeding imports) was desirable; and that government
        should actively promote exports and restrict imports. Although mercantilism was thoroughly
        refuted by Adam Smith and the classical economists, its errors continue to resurface.
      </p>

      <Callout type="info">
        <strong>The Mercantilist Fallacy:</strong> Mercantilists confused money with wealth. They
        thought that accumulating gold and silver made a nation rich. In fact, gold and silver are
        merely media of exchange; real wealth consists of goods and services. A nation that
        accumulated gold while neglecting production would impoverish, not enrich, itself.
      </Callout>

      <h3>The Balance of Trade Obsession</h3>
      <p>
        Mercantilists were obsessed with the balance of trade. They believed that exports were
        beneficial because they brought in gold, while imports were harmful because they sent
        gold abroad. Trade policy should therefore promote exports and restrict imports to
        achieve a "favorable" balance.
      </p>

      <p>
        This analysis is fundamentally flawed. Imports are not costs but benefits—we import goods
        we want. Exports are costs—we give up goods we produce. The purpose of exporting is to
        obtain imports. A nation that exports without importing is giving away its production
        for nothing.
      </p>

      <Callout type="success">
        <strong>Smith's Refutation:</strong> Adam Smith demolished the mercantilist position. He
        showed that the wealth of nations consists of production and consumption, not gold
        accumulation. Free trade benefits both parties by allowing specialization according to
        comparative advantage. Restricting imports impoverishes the nation that imposes the
        restrictions.
      </Callout>

      <h3>Modern Mercantilism</h3>
      <p>
        Despite Smith's refutation, mercantilist ideas persist. Politicians still worry about
        trade deficits, still seek to promote exports and restrict imports, still confuse
        national interest with producer interest. The language has changed, but the underlying
        fallacies remain.
      </p>

      <p>
        Modern protectionists do not speak of accumulating gold; they speak of "saving jobs,"
        "protecting industries," and "maintaining competitiveness." But the effects are the
        same: consumers pay higher prices, resources are misallocated, and the economy is less
        productive than it would be under free trade.
      </p>

      <h3>Who Benefits from Protection?</h3>
      <p>
        Protectionism benefits producers in the protected industry—at the expense of consumers
        and of producers in other industries. The steel tariff benefits steel producers but
        harms steel users (automobile manufacturers, construction companies) and consumers who
        pay higher prices for products containing steel.
      </p>

      <Callout type="warning">
        <strong>The Seen and Unseen:</strong> Bastiat's distinction between the seen and the
        unseen is crucial here. The jobs saved by protection are visible; the jobs lost are
        invisible. The protected industry is identifiable; the industries harmed by higher
        costs are dispersed. Politicians respond to the visible and ignore the invisible.
      </Callout>

      <h3>The National Security Argument</h3>
      <p>
        One mercantilist argument that retains some plausibility is the national security argument.
        Certain industries, it is claimed, are essential for national defense and should be
        protected even at economic cost. We cannot depend on foreign suppliers for military
        essentials.
      </p>

      <p>
        But this argument is routinely abused. Almost any industry can claim to be essential for
        national security; the label becomes a device for securing protection. And even genuine
        security concerns can often be addressed through stockpiling or subsidies rather than
        trade restrictions.
      </p>

      <h3>The Infant Industry Argument</h3>
      <p>
        Another mercantilist argument is the infant industry argument. New industries, it is
        claimed, need protection from established foreign competitors until they can achieve
        economies of scale. Once mature, they will be able to compete without protection.
      </p>

      <Callout type="info">
        <strong>Problems with the Argument:</strong> The infant industry argument assumes that
        government can identify promising industries better than private investors—an implausible
        assumption. It also ignores that "temporary" protection tends to become permanent, as
        protected industries lobby to maintain their privileges.
      </Callout>

      <h3>Trade Wars</h3>
      <p>
        Protectionism invites retaliation. When one nation restricts imports, its trading partners
        may respond in kind. The result is a trade war in which all parties are harmed. The
        lessons of the Smoot-Hawley tariff of 1930, which deepened the Great Depression, have
        not been learned.
      </p>

      <p>
        Free traders are sometimes criticized for being naive—for assuming that other nations will
        reciprocate. But unilateral free trade benefits the nation that practices it regardless
        of what others do. Retaliating against foreign protectionism only adds to the harm.
      </p>

      <h3>Conclusion: Learning from History</h3>
      <p>
        Mercantilism was refuted over two centuries ago, yet its errors persist. Each generation
        must relearn the lessons of free trade. The case for free trade is as strong today as it
        was in Adam Smith's time; only the rhetoric of protectionism has changed.
      </p>

      <Callout type="success">
        <strong>The Lesson:</strong> The mercantilist fallacies—that exports are good, imports
        are bad, and trade must be managed—lead to policies that impoverish nations and breed
        international conflict. Free trade, in contrast, promotes prosperity and peace. The
        lesson of mercantilism is that its errors must be continually combated.
