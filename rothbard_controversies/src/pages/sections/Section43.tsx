      <h2>Lange, Mises and Praxeology: The Retreat from Marxism</h2>

      <p>
        The socialist calculation debate of the twentieth century pitted Mises and the Austrians
        against socialist economists like Oskar Lange. This debate resulted in a fundamental
        retreat from classical Marxism and revealed the theoretical bankruptcy of socialist
        economics. Understanding this debate illuminates the triumph of Austrian theory.
      </p>

      <Callout type="info">
        <strong>The Original Challenge:</strong> In 1920, Mises published his famous article
        demonstrating that economic calculation under socialism is impossible. Without private
        ownership of the means of production, there can be no market for capital goods; without
        markets, there are no prices; and without prices, rational economic calculation cannot
        occur.
      </Callout>

      <h3>The Marxist Background</h3>
      <p>
        Classical Marxism held that socialism would be more productive than capitalism. The
        anarchy of the market would be replaced by rational planning. Production for profit
        would give way to production for use. The wastefulness of competition would be eliminated.
        These claims seemed plausible to many in the early twentieth century.
      </p>

      <p>
        But Marx and his followers never explained how socialist planning would actually work.
        How would planners know what to produce? How would they allocate resources among competing
        uses? How would they determine the relative values of different goods? These questions
        were simply evaded or answered with hand-waving about the wisdom of the planners.
      </p>

      <h3>Mises's Devastating Critique</h3>
      <p>
        Mises's critique cut to the heart of socialist economics. Without private property in
        capital goods, there can be no market exchange of capital goods. Without market exchange,
        there can be no prices for capital goods. And without prices, there is no basis for
        rational calculation of costs and benefits.
      </p>

      <Callout type="success">
        <strong>The Calculation Argument:</strong> The manager of a socialist enterprise faces
        the same choices as a capitalist entrepreneur: whether to use more or less of each
        input, whether to produce more or less of each output. But without prices, he has no
        way to compare alternatives. He is "groping in the dark," as Mises put it.
      </Callout>

      <h3>The Lange "Response"</h3>
      <p>
        Oskar Lange attempted to refute Mises with his model of "market socialism." In Lange's
        scheme, the socialist state would use a trial-and-error process to set prices. Managers
        would be instructed to minimize costs and equate marginal cost to price. The central
        planning board would adjust prices in response to surpluses and shortages.
      </p>

      <p>
        Lange claimed that his system would achieve the same efficiency as capitalism, perhaps
        more. It would avoid the inequalities of capitalism while preserving its efficiency.
        The planning board would play the role of the market in coordinating economic activity.
      </p>

      <h3>The Failure of Market Socialism</h3>
      <p>
        Lange's model was never implemented, and for good reason. It assumes that the planning
        board can obtain information that is actually dispersed among millions of individuals.
        It assumes that managers will follow instructions to minimize costs, though they face
        no personal consequences for failure. It assumes that the trial-and-error process will
        converge on correct prices, though there is no mechanism to ensure this.
      </p>

      <Callout type="warning">
        <strong>The Knowledge Problem:</strong> Hayek's response to Lange emphasized the knowledge
        problem. The information needed for economic coordination is not given to any one mind.
        It exists in dispersed form among all market participants. The price system communicates
        this information; no planning board can replicate this function.
      </Callout>

      <h3>The Retreat from Marxism</h3>
      <p>
        Lange's response to Mises was actually a retreat from classical Marxism. Marx had
        envisioned the abolition of the market; Lange proposed to simulate it. Marx had condemned
        prices as reflections of exploitation; Lange proposed to use them for calculation. The
        "refutation" of Mises was achieved only by abandoning fundamental Marxist positions.
      </p>

      <p>
        Moreover, Lange effectively conceded that capitalism could work. If the market successfully
        coordinates economic activity under capitalism, then socialism must somehow replicate
        this coordination. Lange's scheme was an attempt to graft market mechanisms onto a
        socialist base—a tacit admission that socialism without markets is unworkable.
      </p>

      <h3>The Verdict of History</h3>
      <p>
        The collapse of socialism in 1989–1991 vindicated Mises completely. The socialist
        economies suffered from exactly the calculational chaos he predicted. They could not
        produce efficiently; they could not innovate; they could not satisfy consumer wants.
        Their planning was not rational but arbitrary.
      </p>

      <Callout type="success">
        <strong>Mises Vindicated:</strong> As the socialist economies collapsed, even former
        socialists acknowledged Mises's foresight. What he had shown in 1920 was confirmed by
        seven decades of failed socialist experiments. The calculation argument was not merely
        theoretical; it was empirically confirmed on a massive scale.
      </Callout>

      <h3>Conclusion: The Triumph of Praxeology</h3>
      <p>
        The socialist calculation debate demonstrated the power of praxeological reasoning.
        Mises derived his conclusions from the logic of human action, not from empirical
        observation. His prediction was confirmed decades later when the socialist experiments
        collapsed. Theory preceded and predicted empirical outcomes.
      </p>

      <Callout type="success">
        <strong>The Lesson:</strong> The socialist calculation debate is not merely of historical
        interest. It demonstrates the indispensability of private property and market prices for
        rational economic organization. Any future attempt at central planning will face the
        same insurmountable obstacles that Mises identified a century ago.
