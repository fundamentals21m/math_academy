    question: 'What is the Walrasian general equilibrium framework?',
    options: [
      'A theory of partial markets',
      'A statistical method',
      'A vision of the economy as a system of simultaneous equations determining all prices and quantities',
      'A theory of government planning',
    ],
    correctIndex: 2,
    difficulty: 'medium',
    explanation: 'The Walrasian framework envisions the economy as a system of simultaneous equations that determine all prices and quantities, with all markets clearing in general equilibrium.',

    type: 'multiple-choice',
    question: 'What is a major criticism of the Walrasian framework?',
    options: [
      'It uses too little math',
      'It focuses too much on individuals',
      'It ignores equilibrium',
      'It assumes perfect information and instantaneous adjustment, ignoring entrepreneurship',
    ],
    correctIndex: 3,
    difficulty: 'medium',
    explanation: 'The Walrasian framework assumes perfect information, instantaneous adjustment, and no entrepreneurship—making it mathematically tractable but empirically unrealistic.',

    question: 'What did Schumpeter emphasize about the entrepreneur?',
    options: [
      'Entrepreneurs are passive price-takers',
      'Entrepreneurs only respond to prices',
      'Entrepreneurship is unimportant',
      'Entrepreneurs disrupt equilibrium through innovation, driving "creative destruction"',
    ],
    correctIndex: 3,
    difficulty: 'medium',
    explanation: 'Schumpeter\'s entrepreneur is an innovator who introduces new products, methods, and organizations, creating "creative destruction" that sweeps away old industries and creates new ones.',

    question: 'What problem does the Walrasian treatment of capital have?',
    options: [
      'It aggregates all capital goods into a single homogeneous factor',
      'It ignores capital entirely',
      'It overemphasizes capital',
      'It uses too much detail',
    ],
    correctIndex: 0,
    difficulty: 'hard',
    explanation: 'Walrasian economics typically aggregates all capital goods into a single homogeneous factor, ignoring the heterogeneity and time structure of the capital stock that Austrian economics emphasizes.',

    id: 5,
    type: 'multiple-choice',
    question: 'What did Alvin Hansen\'s "secular stagnation" thesis argue?',
    options: [
      'Mature economies tend toward stagnation as investment opportunities dry up',
      'Economies grow forever',
      'Government should shrink',
      'Capitalism always succeeds',
    ],
    correctIndex: 0,
    difficulty: 'hard',
    explanation: 'Hansen argued that mature economies tend toward stagnation because investment opportunities dry up as population growth slows. Though his conclusions were flawed, his recognition that equilibrium models miss important dynamics was valuable.',

  {
    id: 6,
    type: 'multiple-choice',
    question: 'What Austrian view sees the market as a process of discovery and coordination, not a state of equilibrium?',
    options: [
      'Static analysis',
      'Process view',
      'Equilibrium theory',
      'Steady state model',
    ],
    correctIndex: 1,
    difficulty: 'easy',
    explanation: 'The Austrian view sees the market as a process—a dynamic activity of discovery and coordination—rather than a static state of equilibrium where all is known and settled.',
