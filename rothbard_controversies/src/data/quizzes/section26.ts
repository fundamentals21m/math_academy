    question: 'What was the standard justification for progressive income taxation?',
    options: [
      'Simplicity of collection',
      'Diminishing marginal utility of income—the rich value dollars less',
      'Constitutional requirement',
      'International standards',
    ],
    correctIndex: 1,
    difficulty: 'medium',
    explanation: 'Progressive taxation was justified by diminishing marginal utility—the claim that rich people value additional dollars less. Therefore taking from the rich supposedly causes less disutility than taking from the poor.',
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    type: 'multiple-choice',
    question: 'What is the Austrian critique of interpersonal utility comparisons?',
    options: [
      'They are mathematically complex',
      'They are scientifically meaningless—utility cannot be compared between individuals',
      'They are politically biased',
      'They are too expensive to calculate',
    ],
    correctIndex: 1,
    difficulty: 'hard',
    explanation: 'Utility is subjective and ordinal. There is no scientific basis for comparing one person\'s utility to another\'s. We cannot know how much a dollar means to the rich versus the poor.',
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    type: 'multiple-choice',
    question: 'How does progressive taxation affect incentives?',
    options: [
      'It has no effect on behavior',
      'It penalizes success—higher earnings face higher marginal rates, discouraging effort',
      'It encourages saving',
      'It reduces inequality without costs',
    ],
    correctIndex: 1,
    difficulty: 'medium',
    explanation: 'Progressive taxation penalizes success. Higher earnings face higher marginal rates, discouraging effort and risk-taking at the margin. The more you earn, the higher percentage the government takes.',
  },
  {
    id: 4,
    type: 'multiple-choice',
    question: 'What is "bracket creep"?',
    options: [
      'Tax rates slowly increasing',
      'Inflation pushing taxpayers into higher brackets with no real income increase',
      'Government expanding tax categories',
      'Filing deadlines moving earlier',
    ],
    correctIndex: 1,
    difficulty: 'medium',
    explanation: 'Bracket creep occurs when inflation pushes taxpayers into higher marginal brackets even though their real income hasn\'t increased. They pay more taxes without being better off.',
  },
  {
    id: 5,
    type: 'multiple-choice',
    question: 'What would be a more neutral form of income taxation?',
    options: [
      'Higher rates on the wealthy',
      'A flat rate—the same percentage for everyone',
      'No income tax at all',
      'Rates based on occupation',
    ],
    correctIndex: 1,
    difficulty: 'easy',
    explanation: 'A flat tax—the same percentage for everyone—would be more neutral. However, Rothbard would argue that no income tax would be best, since all taxation involves taking property without consent.',
  },
  {
    id: 6,
    type: 'multiple-choice',
    question: 'What type of tax applies the same percentage rate to all income levels?',
    options: [
      'Progressive tax',
      'Flat tax',
      'Regressive tax',
      'Excise tax',
    ],
    correctIndex: 1,
    difficulty: 'easy',
    explanation: 'A flat tax applies the same percentage to all income levels. Unlike progressive taxation, it doesn\'t create increasing marginal disincentives as income rises.',
  },
