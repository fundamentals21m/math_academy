    question: 'What is the most common methodological criticism of Austrian economics?',
    options: [
      'It uses too much mathematics',
      'It is not empirically testable due to its reliance on praxeological deduction',
      'It is too complex',
      'It uses too many experiments',
    ],
    correctIndex: 1,
    difficulty: 'medium',
    explanation: 'Critics argue that Austrian reliance on deduction from the action axiom makes the theory unfalsifiable. If conclusions follow logically from axioms, empirical evidence cannot refute them.',
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    type: 'multiple-choice',
    question: 'What is the Austrian response to the empiricism critique?',
    options: [
      'Economics should use experiments',
      'Economic laws are true by their nature; empirical testing tests auxiliary conditions, not the laws themselves',
      'The critique is completely valid',
      'Austrians reject all evidence',
    ],
    correctIndex: 1,
    difficulty: 'hard',
    explanation: 'Austrians argue that praxeological laws are necessarily true. Empirical "tests" actually test whether auxiliary conditions (ceteris paribus) held. Apparent disconfirmation indicates other factors intervened.',
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    type: 'multiple-choice',
    question: 'Why do mainstream economists criticize Austrian rejection of econometrics?',
    options: [
      'Econometrics is easy',
      'Without quantitative testing, they argue, economics becomes mere ideology',
      'Econometrics is cheap',
      'Everyone agrees with Austrians',
    ],
    correctIndex: 1,
    difficulty: 'medium',
    explanation: 'Mainstream critics argue that without empirical testing and quantification, Austrian economics cannot distinguish truth from ideology. Science requires testable predictions.',
  },
  {
    id: 4,
    type: 'multiple-choice',
    question: 'What is the Austrian critique of econometric methods?',
    options: [
      'Math is too hard',
      'Economic data does not satisfy the conditions for valid statistical inference',
      'Computers are unreliable',
      'Data collection is impossible',
    ],
    correctIndex: 1,
    difficulty: 'hard',
    explanation: 'Austrians argue that economic data does not satisfy conditions for valid statistical inference—no controlled experiments, no constant parameters, no independent observations. Econometric "tests" are unreliable.',
  },
  {
    id: 5,
    type: 'multiple-choice',
    question: 'How do Austrians respond to charges that their method is "unscientific"?',
    options: [
      'They accept the charge',
      'They argue that aping natural science methods is inappropriate for studying human action',
      'They use more mathematics',
      'They conduct experiments',
    ],
    correctIndex: 1,
    difficulty: 'medium',
    explanation: 'Austrians argue that human action differs fundamentally from natural phenomena. Trying to apply natural science methods to economics is inappropriate—a different methodology is required.',
  },
  {
    id: 6,
    type: 'multiple-choice',
    question: 'What mainstream economic approach do Austrians criticize for inappropriately applying natural science methods to economics?',
    options: [
      'Microeconomics',
      'Econometrics',
      'Game theory',
      'Macroeconomics',
    ],
    correctIndex: 1,
    difficulty: 'easy',
    explanation: 'Austrians criticize econometrics for trying to apply statistical methods appropriate to controlled experiments to economic data that lacks the required properties.',
