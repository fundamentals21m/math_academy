    question: 'What internal debates exist within Austrian economics?',
    options: [
      'There are no debates',
      'Debates over fractional reserve banking, intellectual property, and methodology',
      'All Austrians agree on everything',
      'Debates only with outsiders',
    ],
    correctIndex: 1,
    difficulty: 'medium',
    explanation: 'Austrian economists debate among themselves about fractional reserve banking (fraud or legitimate?), intellectual property (valid or not?), and methodological questions about the role of empirical work.',
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    type: 'multiple-choice',
    question: 'What is the debate about fractional reserve banking within Austrian circles?',
    options: [
      'All agree it is good',
      'Some see it as fraud, others as legitimate banking that emerges in free markets',
      'All agree it should be banned',
      'No Austrian discusses banking',
    ],
    correctIndex: 1,
    difficulty: 'hard',
    explanation: 'Some Austrians (following Rothbard) see fractional reserves as fraudulent—banks promise to pay on demand money they don\'t have. Others (following Selgin) see it as legitimate free banking.',
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    type: 'multiple-choice',
    question: 'How do Austrians differ on intellectual property?',
    options: [
      'All support strong IP',
      'Some see it as legitimate property, others as government-granted monopoly inconsistent with property rights',
      'All oppose IP',
      'IP is not discussed',
    ],
    correctIndex: 1,
    difficulty: 'hard',
    explanation: 'Some Austrians defend IP as property in one\'s creations. Others (following Kinsella) argue IP is government-granted monopoly that restricts use of one\'s physical property and is inconsistent with libertarian principles.',
  },

    id: 4,
    type: 'multiple-choice',
    question: 'What is the methodological divide between "Misesians" and "Hayekians"?',
    options: [
      'There is no divide',
      'Misesians emphasize pure deduction; Hayekians are more open to empirical and evolutionary analysis',
      'Hayekians reject praxeology completely',
      'Misesians use econometrics',
    ],
    correctIndex: 1,
    difficulty: 'hard',
    explanation: 'Misesians strictly follow praxeological deduction from the action axiom. Hayekians are more open to empirical work, evolutionary analysis, and engagement with other schools. Both remain distinctively Austrian.',

  {
    id: 5,
    type: 'multiple-choice',
    question: 'Why are these internal debates healthy for Austrian economics?',
    options: [
      'They cause confusion',
      'They show the school is intellectually active and not dogmatic',
      'They weaken the school',
      'They should be suppressed',
    ],
    correctIndex: 1,
    difficulty: 'easy',
    explanation: 'Internal debates show intellectual vitality. A school that permits no dissent becomes dogmatic. These debates clarify issues and allow the best arguments to emerge through scholarly exchange.',

    question: 'What controversial practice do some Austrians see as fraud while others see as legitimate free banking?',
    options: [
      'Central banking',
      'Fractional reserve banking',
      'Investment banking',
      'Retail banking',
    ],
    correctIndex: 1,
    difficulty: 'easy',
    explanation: 'Fractional reserve banking divides Austrians. Some see it as fraud (promising to pay on demand what you don\'t have); others see it as legitimate banking that would emerge in free markets.',
  },
