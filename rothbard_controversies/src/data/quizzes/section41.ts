    question: 'What is fractional reserve banking?',
    options: [
      'Banks holding only a fraction of deposits as reserves while lending the rest',
      'Banking for fractions of society',
      'Dividing banks into fractions',
      'Partial banking services',
    ],
    correctIndex: 0,
    difficulty: 'easy',
    explanation: 'Fractional reserve banking means banks hold only a fraction of deposits as reserves, lending out the rest. If everyone tried to withdraw at once, banks couldn\'t pay—they don\'t have the money.',
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    type: 'multiple-choice',
    question: 'How does fractional reserve banking create money?',
    options: [
      'By printing currency',
      'Loans create new deposits, which can be loaned again, multiplying the money supply',
      'By mining gold',
      'By government order',
    ],
    correctIndex: 1,
    difficulty: 'medium',
    explanation: 'When banks lend, they create new deposits. These deposits can be withdrawn and deposited elsewhere, enabling more loans. This process multiplies the money supply beyond the original reserves.',
  },

    type: 'multiple-choice',
    question: 'What is a "bank run"?',
    options: [
      'A race between banks',
      'A new branch opening',
      'Depositors rushing to withdraw funds when they fear the bank cannot pay',
      'A bank closing for the day',
    ],
    correctIndex: 2,
    difficulty: 'easy',
    explanation: 'A bank run occurs when depositors rush to withdraw, fearing the bank cannot pay. Under fractional reserves, banks can\'t pay everyone simultaneously—they\'ve lent out the deposits.',
  },

    type: 'multiple-choice',
    question: 'Why is fractional reserve banking criticized by some Austrians?',
    options: [
      'It is too profitable',
      'It is too safe',
      'It reduces bank profits',
      'It creates money from nothing, potentially constituting fraud and causing business cycles',
    ],
    correctIndex: 3,
    difficulty: 'hard',
    explanation: 'Some Austrians argue fractional reserves are fraudulent—banks promise to pay on demand money they don\'t have. This credit expansion also distorts interest rates and causes business cycles.',
  },
  {
    id: 5,
    type: 'multiple-choice',
    question: 'What is 100% reserve banking?',
    options: [
      'Banks holding all deposits in reserve, lending only from time deposits',
      'Banking only for the wealthy',
      'Government-owned banking',
      'Banking with 100% profits',
    ],
    correctIndex: 0,
    difficulty: 'medium',
    explanation: '100% reserve banking means banks keep all demand deposits in reserve. They can only lend from time deposits where depositors explicitly agree to lock up funds. Some Austrians advocate this system.',
  },

    options: [
      'Bank holiday',
      'Bank merger',
      'Bank audit',
      'Bank run',
    ],
    correctIndex: 3,
    difficulty: 'easy',
    explanation: 'A bank run occurs when depositors lose confidence and rush to withdraw. Under fractional reserves, this can cause bank failures since banks don\'t hold enough reserves for all depositors.',
  },
