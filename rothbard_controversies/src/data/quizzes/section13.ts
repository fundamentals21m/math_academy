    type: 'multiple-choice',
    question: 'What does Pareto efficiency mean?',
    options: [
      'Maximum production at minimum cost',
      'No one can be made better off without making someone else worse off',
      'Perfect competition',
      'Government-optimal allocation',
    ],
    correctIndex: 1,
    difficulty: 'medium',
    explanation: 'A Pareto-efficient arrangement is one where no rearrangement of resources could make some people better off without making others worse off.',
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    type: 'multiple-choice',
    question: 'Why is efficiency problematic as a sole criterion for evaluating economic arrangements?',
    options: [
      'It\'s too hard to measure',
      'Many arrangements are Pareto efficient, including very unequal ones',
      'It only applies to markets',
      'Politicians don\'t understand it',
    ],
    correctIndex: 1,
    difficulty: 'hard',
    explanation: 'Many arrangements are Pareto efficient; the criterion cannot tell us which to prefer. A world where one person owned everything could be Pareto efficient. Questions of justice and distribution cannot be subsumed under efficiency.',
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    type: 'multiple-choice',
    question: 'What do Austrian economists emphasize about the market compared to static efficiency?',
    options: [
      'Mathematical optimization',
      'The market is a dynamic process of discovery and adaptation',
      'Equilibrium states',
      'Government planning',
    ],
    correctIndex: 1,
    difficulty: 'medium',
    explanation: 'Austrian economists emphasize that the market is a dynamic process of discovery and adaptation, not a static equilibrium. The relevant question is whether the market tends to correct errors and adapt to change.',
  },
  {
    id: 4,
    type: 'multiple-choice',
    question: 'What deeper problem arises when efficiency analysis takes the existing property distribution as given?',
    options: [
      'Math becomes too complex',
      'The existing distribution may be the product of past injustice',
      'Prices are unstable',
      'Government cannot intervene',
    ],
    correctIndex: 1,
    difficulty: 'hard',
    explanation: 'If property was acquired through theft or fraud, then the "efficient" allocation based on that distribution has no moral standing. Efficiency cannot serve as a foundation without a prior theory of just property.',
  },
  {
    id: 5,
    type: 'multiple-choice',
    question: 'What is the deepest problem with efficiency as a criterion?',
    options: [
      'It ignores money',
      'It ignores freedom—an arrangement might be efficient while severely restricting liberty',
      'It\'s too complicated',
      'It ignores technology',
    ],
    correctIndex: 1,
    difficulty: 'medium',
    explanation: 'The deepest problem is that efficiency ignores freedom. A well-managed slave plantation might be efficient. The market is valuable primarily because it respects individual freedom, not because it is efficient.',
  },
  {
    id: 6,
    type: 'multiple-choice',
    question: 'What are the proper criteria for evaluating economic arrangements, according to the Austrian view?',
    options: [
      'Efficiency and growth',
      'Justice and liberty',
      'Equality and stability',
      'Democracy and consensus',
    ],
    correctIndex: 1,
    difficulty: 'medium',
    explanation: 'The proper criteria are justice and liberty. A just economy respects property rights; a free economy allows individuals to pursue their own goals without coercive interference.',
  },
