    question: 'What was the original assumption of welfare economics that was later discredited?',
    options: [
      'Markets always fail',
      'Utility could be measured and compared across individuals',
      'Government always succeeds',
      'Prices are fixed',
    ],
    correctIndex: 1,
    difficulty: 'medium',
    explanation: 'The original welfare economists assumed that utility could be measured and compared across individuals, allowing them to make policy recommendations based on maximizing total utility.',
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    type: 'multiple-choice',
    question: 'Why can\'t utilities be aggregated across individuals?',
    options: [
      'Utility is ordinal, not cardinal—we cannot measure or add subjective utilities',
      'Math is too hard',
      'People lie about preferences',
      'Government prevents it',
    ],
    correctIndex: 0,
    difficulty: 'medium',
    explanation: 'Utility is ordinal, not cardinal. We can say Jones prefers A to B, but not that his preference is twice as strong. We cannot add or compare the subjective utilities of different individuals.',
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    type: 'multiple-choice',
    question: 'What is the Kaldor-Hicks compensation principle?',
    options: [
      'Everyone must be compensated',
      'No compensation is ever needed',
      'Losers should compensate winners',
      'A change is desirable if winners could compensate losers and still be better off, even without actual compensation',
    ],
    correctIndex: 3,
    difficulty: 'hard',
    explanation: 'The Kaldor-Hicks principle says a change is desirable if winners could compensate losers and still be better off—even if no compensation actually occurs. This hypothetical compensation supposedly avoids interpersonal comparisons.',
  },
  {
    id: 4,
    type: 'multiple-choice',
    question: 'What is the Austrian alternative to mainstream welfare economics?',
    options: [
      'Demonstrated preference through voluntary exchange—the only unambiguous welfare improvement',
      'Cost-benefit analysis',
      'Government surveys',
      'Mathematical optimization',
    ],
    correctIndex: 0,
    difficulty: 'medium',
    explanation: 'The Austrian approach uses "demonstrated preference"—when parties voluntarily exchange, we can say with confidence both expect to benefit. Voluntary exchange is the only unambiguous welfare improvement.',
  },
  {
    id: 5,
    type: 'multiple-choice',
    question: 'Why can\'t government intervention be scientifically shown to improve welfare?',
    options: [
      'Government is always wrong',
      'Science doesn\\\\'t apply to government',
      'Every intervention benefits some at the expense of others; we cannot scientifically compare gains and losses',
      'Welfare is irrelevant',
    ],
    correctIndex: 2,
    difficulty: 'hard',
    explanation: 'Every intervention benefits some at the expense of others; we cannot scientifically compare the gains and losses. And intervention replaces voluntary exchange with coercion—we cannot assume the coerced parties benefit.',
  },
  {
    id: 6,
    type: 'multiple-choice',
    question: 'What Austrian approach observes that parties chose to trade, demonstrating they preferred trading to not trading?',
    options: [
      'Revealed utility',
      'Demonstrated preference',
      'Measured satisfaction',
      'Calculated welfare',
    ],
    correctIndex: 1,
    difficulty: 'medium',
    explanation: 'The "demonstrated preference" approach avoids measuring utilities. We simply observe that parties chose to trade, which demonstrates they preferred trading to not trading.',
  },
