    type: 'multiple-choice',
    question: 'What is a quota?',
    options: [
      'A tax on imports',
      'A government-imposed limit on the quantity of a good that can be imported',
      'A trade agreement',
      'A production target',
    ],
    correctIndex: 1,
    difficulty: 'easy',
    explanation: 'A quota is a quantitative limit on imports. Unlike tariffs, which allow unlimited imports at a higher price, quotas physically restrict the amount that can enter the country.',
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    type: 'multiple-choice',
    question: 'How do quotas differ from tariffs in their effects?',
    options: [
      'They are identical',
      'Quotas benefit consumers more',
      'Quotas create rents for those holding import licenses instead of government revenue',
      'Tariffs are more restrictive',
    ],
    correctIndex: 2,
    difficulty: 'medium',
    explanation: 'Quotas create rents for quota-holders rather than revenue for government. The difference between the low foreign price and high domestic price goes to those with import licenses rather than the treasury.',
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    type: 'multiple-choice',
    question: 'What are non-tariff barriers (NTBs)?',
    options: [
      'Language differences',
      'Cultural preferences',
      'Geographic obstacles',
      'Regulations, standards, and procedures that restrict imports without explicit tariffs',
    ],
    correctIndex: 3,
    difficulty: 'medium',
    explanation: 'Non-tariff barriers include regulations, standards, licensing, and procedures that restrict imports without explicit tariffs. As tariffs have declined, NTBs have become more important forms of protection.',
  },
  {
    id: 4,
    type: 'multiple-choice',
    question: 'Why have non-tariff barriers proliferated as tariffs have declined?',
    options: [
      'Governments became more efficient',
      'Consumers demanded them',
      'Protectionist interests use regulations as a substitute for tariffs',
      'International law required them',
    ],
    correctIndex: 2,
    difficulty: 'hard',
    explanation: 'As tariffs were reduced through trade agreements, protectionist interests found other ways to restrict competition. Regulatory barriers are less transparent and easier to justify as serving non-trade purposes.',
  },
  {
    id: 5,
    type: 'multiple-choice',
    question: 'What is a "voluntary export restraint"?',
    options: [
      'Foreign governments limiting exports to avoid even more restrictive measures',
      'A company\\\'s choice not to export',
      'A quality standard',
      'An environmental regulation',
    ],
    correctIndex: 0,
    difficulty: 'medium',
    explanation: 'Voluntary export restraints are agreements where foreign governments limit exports to avoid tariffs or quotas. They are "voluntary" in name only—the alternative is worse restrictions.',
  },
  {
    id: 6,
    type: 'multiple-choice',
    question: 'What type of trade barrier limits the quantity of imports rather than taxing them?',
    options: [
      'Tariff',
      'Subsidy',
      'Embargo',
      'Quota',
    ],
    correctIndex: 3,
    difficulty: 'easy',
    explanation: 'A quota directly limits the quantity of goods that can be imported, as opposed to a tariff which taxes them but allows unlimited quantity.',
  },
