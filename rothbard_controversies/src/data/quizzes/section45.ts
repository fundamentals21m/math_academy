    question: 'What is free banking?',
    options: [
      'Banks that charge no fees',
      'A system where private banks issue competing currencies without central bank monopoly',
      'Government-owned banks',
      'Banks for the poor only',
    ],
    correctIndex: 1,
    difficulty: 'easy',
    explanation: 'Free banking is a system where private banks issue their own currencies, typically backed by commodities like gold, competing for depositors without a government-imposed central bank monopoly.',
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    type: 'multiple-choice',
    question: 'How would market discipline work in a free banking system?',
    options: [
      'Government regulation',
      'Banks that over-issue notes would face redemption demands they cannot meet',
      'Central bank supervision',
      'International oversight',
    ],
    correctIndex: 1,
    difficulty: 'medium',
    explanation: 'Market discipline means banks that over-issue notes face redemption demands. If they cannot pay in gold, they fail. This constrains money creation without government regulation.',
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    type: 'multiple-choice',
    question: 'What historical examples of free banking exist?',
    options: [
      'None exist',
      'Scotland (1716-1845), Canada, and parts of the United States',
      'Only in theory',
      'Ancient Rome only',
    ],
    correctIndex: 1,
    difficulty: 'medium',
    explanation: 'Free banking operated successfully in Scotland for over a century, in Canada, and in some U.S. states. These systems were generally stable and innovative before being replaced by central banking.',
  },
  {
    id: 4,
    type: 'multiple-choice',
    question: 'Why do Austrians argue free banking would be more stable than central banking?',
    options: [
      'Banks would be larger',
      'Competition and redemption requirements prevent over-expansion that causes cycles',
      'Government would still control banks',
      'There would be no banks',
    ],
    correctIndex: 1,
    difficulty: 'hard',
    explanation: 'Free banking constrains money creation through redemption requirements and competition. Without a central bank to bail out over-expanded banks, they must remain prudent. This prevents the credit expansion that causes cycles.',
  },
  {
    id: 5,
    type: 'multiple-choice',
    question: 'What role would a commodity standard play in free banking?',
    options: [
      'None',
      'Bank notes would be redeemable in gold or silver, anchoring money to real value',
      'Only for decoration',
      'To prevent bank formation',
    ],
    correctIndex: 1,
    difficulty: 'medium',
    explanation: 'Under free banking, notes would typically be redeemable in gold or silver. This anchors money to real value and provides automatic discipline—banks cannot create money beyond their reserves.',
  },
  {
