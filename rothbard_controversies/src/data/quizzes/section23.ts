    question: 'Why did gradualism prove disastrous for transitioning from socialism?',
    options: [
      'Partial reforms create the worst of both worlds—neither market coordination nor central control',
      'It was too fast',
      'It was too expensive',
      'International opposition',
    ],
    correctIndex: 0,
    difficulty: 'medium',
    explanation: 'Gradualism created the worst of both worlds. Managers stripped assets; politicians distributed favors to cronies. Gradualism prolongs agony rather than avoiding it.',
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    type: 'multiple-choice',
    question: 'What problem did voucher privatization have?',
    options: [
      'Vouchers were too valuable',
      'Too few vouchers were issued',
      'Most citizens couldn\'t evaluate businesses; vouchers were bought up by insiders at low prices',
      'Vouchers were illegal'
    ],
    correctIndex: 2,
    difficulty: 'medium',
    explanation: 'Most citizens know nothing about evaluating businesses. Vouchers were quickly bought up by insiders and speculators at low prices, resulting in concentration of ownership rather than democratization.',
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    type: 'multiple-choice',
    question: 'What is the "homesteading principle" for desocialization?',
    options: [
      'Build new homes first',
      'Foreign investors take over',
      'Government keeps ownership',
      'Those who actually use an asset—workers in factories, farmers on land—should become its owners'
    ],
    correctIndex: 3,
    difficulty: 'medium',
    explanation: 'The homesteading principle says those who use an asset should become its owners. They have made it productive through labor, have the most knowledge of how to use it, and have the strongest incentives.',

  {
    id: 4,
    type: 'multiple-choice',
    question: 'What should accompany privatization according to the Austrian prescription?',
    options: [
      'More regulations',
      'Immediate liberation—removal of all restrictions on economic activity',
      'Gradual price increases',
      'Foreign aid dependency',
    ],
    correctIndex: 1,
    difficulty: 'medium',
    explanation: 'All restrictions on economic activity should be removed immediately: price controls, licensing requirements, trade restrictions, and regulations. This liberates entrepreneurial energy and allows the market to begin coordinating.',

  {
    id: 5,
    type: 'multiple-choice',
    question: 'Which country\'s "shock therapy" produced rapid recovery compared to gradualist alternatives?',
    options: [
      'Poland',
      'Russia',
      'Ukraine',
      'Romania',
    ],
    correctIndex: 0,
    difficulty: 'easy',
    explanation: 'Poland\'s "shock therapy" was initially painful but produced rapid recovery. Russia\'s gradualism enriched oligarchs while impoverishing the population. The evidence supports the Austrian approach.',
  },
  {
    id: 6,
    type: 'multiple-choice',
    question: 'What type of approach does Austrian economics recommend for desocialization?',
    options: [
      'Gradual and partial',
      'Rapid and thorough',
      'Foreign-led',
      'Government-managed',
    ],
    correctIndex: 1,
    difficulty: 'easy',
    explanation: 'The Austrian prescription for desocialization is rapid and thorough: free prices, free trade, and rapid privatization to workers and users. This minimizes the transitional period and reduces corruption opportunities.',
