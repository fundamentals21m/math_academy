    question: 'What is immigration from an Austrian economics perspective?',
    options: [
      'The movement of labor across borders, subject to the same principles as other trade',
      'A government program',
      'Central planning of population',
      'A threat to markets',
    ],
    correctIndex: 0,
    difficulty: 'medium',
    explanation: 'Immigration is the movement of labor across borders. Like trade in goods, it involves voluntary exchange and is subject to the same economic principles—benefits from specialization and comparative advantage.',
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    type: 'multiple-choice',
    question: 'What is the "lump of labor" fallacy?',
    options: [
      'Believing there are a fixed number of jobs so immigrants take jobs from natives',
      'Labor markets are efficient',
      'All labor is the same',
      'Labor cannot move'
    ],
    correctIndex: 0,
    difficulty: 'medium',
    explanation: 'The lump of labor fallacy assumes a fixed number of jobs. In reality, immigrants also consume goods and services, creating jobs. The economy expands with population; jobs are not fixed.',

    type: 'multiple-choice',
    question: 'What is the libertarian tension regarding open borders?',
    options: [
      'There is no tension',
      'All libertarians agree completely',
      'Only security matters',
      'Balancing free movement with private property rights and concerns about welfare states',
    ],
    correctIndex: 3,
    difficulty: 'hard',
    explanation: 'Libertarians debate whether truly open borders are consistent with private property rights and whether immigrants accessing welfare programs changes the analysis. Some support open borders; others advocate property-based restrictions.',

    id: 4,
    type: 'multiple-choice',
    question: 'How do immigration restrictions affect wages?',
    options: [
      'They only affect immigrant wages',

      'They always raise all wages'
    ],
    correctIndex: 2,
    difficulty: 'medium',
    explanation: 'Restricting immigration may raise wages in some sectors by limiting labor supply. However, consumers pay higher prices, and potential gains from trade and specialization are lost.',
  },
  {
    id: 5,
    type: 'multiple-choice',
    question: 'What role do private property rights play in libertarian immigration discussions?',
    options: [
      'No role at all',
      'Property rights only apply to citizens',
      'Government should override property rights',
      'Property owners should decide who enters their property; the issue is about public spaces'
    ],
    correctIndex: 3,
    difficulty: 'hard',
    explanation: 'Libertarians emphasize that property owners should decide who enters their property. The debate centers on public spaces—roads, parks—which some argue should also be privatized.',

      'Free lunch fallacy',
    ],
    correctIndex: 1,
    difficulty: 'easy',
    explanation: 'The lump of labor fallacy assumes jobs are fixed in number. In reality, immigrants also consume goods and create jobs; the economy expands with population.',
