    question: 'What is the fundamental axiom of praxeology?',
    options: [
      'All men are created equal',
      'Individual human beings act—they have goals and employ means to achieve them',
      'Supply equals demand in equilibrium',
      'Markets are efficient',
    ],
    correctIndex: 1,
    difficulty: 'easy',
    explanation: 'The fundamental axiom of praxeology is that individual human beings act—that is, they have goals and purposes, and they employ means to try to attain these goals.',
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    type: 'multiple-choice',
    question: 'What is the relationship between praxeology and psychology?',
    options: [
      'They are competing theories',
      'Psychology replaces praxeology',
      'Praxeology takes preferences as given; psychology studies why people adopt them',
      'They are the same discipline',
    ],
    correctIndex: 2,
    difficulty: 'medium',
    explanation: 'Psychology studies how and why people adopt preferences; praxeology takes preferences as given and studies the formal implications of acting on those preferences. They are complementary.',

    type: 'multiple-choice',
    question: 'What is methodological individualism?',
    options: [
      'A theory that individuals are selfish',
      'All social phenomena must ultimately be traced back to the actions of individuals',
      'A belief that individuals should act alone',
      'A statistical method focused on individuals',
    ],
    correctIndex: 1,
    difficulty: 'medium',
    explanation: 'Methodological individualism holds that all social phenomena must be traced back to individual actions. There is no "group mind" or "social forces" acting apart from individuals.',

    id: 4,
    type: 'multiple-choice',
    question: 'Why can\'t empiricism establish the universal laws that praxeology derives?',
    options: [
      'Empirical data is too expensive to collect',
      'No number of observations can prove what men always do in all circumstances',
      'Scientists disagree too much',
      'Technology is insufficient',
    ],
    correctIndex: 1,
    difficulty: 'hard',
    explanation: 'No number of observations can prove that men always prefer more of a good to less, or always seek to economize. These truths are grasped by understanding the nature of action itself, not by counting observations.',
  },
  {
    id: 5,
    type: 'multiple-choice',
    question: 'Which category is inherent in all human action?',
    options: [
      'Mathematical precision',
      'Government approval',
      'Time',
      'Social cooperation',
    ],
    correctIndex: 2,
    difficulty: 'easy',
    explanation: 'Time is particularly important—every action aims at achieving a more satisfactory state in the future. Time is always a scarce resource that every actor must consider.',

    question: 'What term describes the a priori method of deriving true conclusions from a true axiom through valid logic?',
    options: [
      'Econometrics',
      'Praxeology',
      'Empiricism',
      'Positivism',
    ],
    correctIndex: 1,
    difficulty: 'easy',
    explanation: 'Praxeology is the a priori science of human action. If the axiom is true and the logical deduction is valid, then the conclusions must also be true.',
