    explanation: 'The Weak Nullstellensatz says that over an algebraically closed field, every proper ideal has a common zero. Equivalently, the maximal ideals of $k[x_1, \\ldots, x_n]$ are exactly $(x_1 - a_1, \\ldots, x_n - a_n)$ for $a_i \\in k$.',

    explanation: 'Over $\\mathbb{R}$, the ideal $(x^2 + 1)$ has $V(x^2 + 1) = \\emptyset$ since $x^2 + 1 > 0$ for all real $x$. This shows the Nullstellensatz fails over non-algebraically closed fields.',

    explanation: 'By the Weak Nullstellensatz, maximal ideals of $k[x_1, \\ldots, x_n]$ correspond to points: the maximal ideal at $(a_1, \\ldots, a_n)$ is $(x_1 - a_1, \\ldots, x_n - a_n)$.',
