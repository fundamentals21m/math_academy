      <p className="mb-4">
        Before advancing to the analysis of diverse policy schemes from the standpoint of economic
        theory and political philosophy, it is essential to introduce and explain the basic concepts
        used throughout this study. The concepts explained in this chapter—property, contract,
        aggression, capitalism and socialism—are so fundamental that one cannot avoid making use of
        them, if at times only implicitly.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        Because the concept of property is so basic that everyone seems to have some immediate
        understanding of it, most people never think about it carefully and can produce at best a
        very vague definition. But starting from imprecisely stated definitions and building a complex
        network of thought upon them can lead only to intellectual disaster.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-dark-100 mt-8 mb-4">The Foundation: Scarcity</h3>

      <Definition title="Scarcity and Property">
        <p>
          For a concept of property to arise, there must be a <strong>scarcity of goods</strong>. Should
          there be no scarcity, and should all goods be "free goods" whose use by any one person for any
          one purpose would not in any way exclude its use by any other person, then there would be no
          need for property.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2">
          It is the function of property rights to avoid possible clashes over the use of scarce
          resources by assigning rights of exclusive ownership. Property is thus a <strong>normative
          concept</strong>: a concept designed to make conflict-free interaction possible by stipulating
          mutually binding rules of conduct (norms) regarding scarce resources.
        </p>
      </Definition>

      <p className="mb-4">
        Even if we were to assume that we lived in a Garden of Eden, where there was a superabundance
        of everything needed to sustain life, the concept of property would necessarily have to evolve.
        For even under these ideal circumstances, every person's physical body would still be a scarce
        resource and thus the need for property rules regarding people's bodies would exist.
      </p>

      <Callout type="info" title="The Body as Prototype">
        <p>
          One's body is the <strong>prototype of a scarce good</strong> for which property rights must
          be established. As long as a person acts—intentionally trying to change a state of affairs
          perceived as less satisfactory into one that appears more rewarding—this action necessarily
          involves a choice regarding the use of this person's body. Time itself is scarce: the time
          used pursuing one goal reduces time left to pursue others.
        </p>
      </Callout>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-dark-100 mt-8 mb-4">The Natural Theory of Property</h3>

      <Definition title="Self-Ownership">
        <p>
          According to the natural position regarding property: <strong>Every person has the exclusive
          right of ownership of his body within the boundaries of its surface.</strong> Every person
          can put his body to those uses that he thinks best for his immediate or long-run interest,
          well-being, or satisfaction, as long as he does not interfere with another person's rights
          to control their respective body.
        </p>
      </Definition>

      <p className="mb-4">
        This ownership of one's own body implies the right to invite (agree to) another person's doing
        something with one's own body: my right to do with my body whatever I want includes the right
        to ask and let someone else use my body, love it, examine it, inject medicines into it, or
        change its physical appearance, if that is what I agree to.
      </p>

      <Definition title="Contractual Exchange">
        <p>
          <strong>Contractual exchanges</strong> are interpersonal relationships characterized by the
          fact that an agreement on the use of scarce resources is reached, based on mutual respect
          and recognition of each exchanging partner's domain of exclusive control over their
          respective bodies.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2">
          By definition, such contractual exchanges are always, and necessarily so, <strong>mutually
          advantageous</strong> for every participant ex ante, otherwise the exchange simply would
          not take place.
        </p>
      </Definition>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-dark-100 mt-8 mb-4">Aggression Defined</h3>

      <Definition title="Aggression">
        <p>
          If an action is performed that <strong>uninvitedly invades or changes the physical integrity
          of another person's body</strong> and puts this body to a use that is not to this very
          person's own liking, this action is called <strong>aggression</strong>.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2">
          It would also be aggression if a person were physically stopped from performing certain
          actions with his body which might not be to someone else's liking, but which, if performed,
          would not in itself cause a change in the physical integrity of any other person's property.
        </p>
      </Definition>

      <Theorem title="The Nature of Aggression">
        <p>
          By definition, an aggressive act always and necessarily implies that a person, by performing
          it, increases his or her satisfaction <strong>at the expense of a decrease</strong> in the
          satisfaction of another person.
        </p>
      </Theorem>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-dark-100 mt-8 mb-4">The Rationale of Natural Property</h3>

      <p className="mb-4">
        At the bottom of the natural property theory lies the idea of basing the assignment of an
        exclusive ownership right on the existence of an <strong>objective, intersubjectively
        ascertainable link</strong> between owner and property owned. Property claims that can only
        invoke purely subjective evidence are considered aggressive.
      </p>

      <Example title="The Objective Link">
        <p className="mb-3">
          I can cite in favor of my property claim regarding my body the objective fact that I was
          the body's first occupant—its first user. Anyone else claiming to control this body cannot
          cite anything of the sort.
        </p>
        <p>
          No one could call my body a product of his will, as I could claim it to be the product of
          mine. Such a claim would be based exclusively on subjective opinion, on a merely verbal
          declaration that things should be this or that way.
        </p>
      </Example>

      <Definition title="Original Appropriation">
        <p>
          Unlike bodies, which are never "unowned" but always have a natural owner, other scarce
          resources can be unowned as long as they remain in their natural state, unused by anyone.
          They become someone's property once they are treated as scarce means—as soon as they are
          occupied in some objective borders and put to some specific use by someone.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2">
          This act of acquiring previously unowned resources is called <strong>original
          appropriation</strong>. Once unowned resources are appropriated, it becomes an aggression
          to uninvitedly change their physical characteristics or restrict the range of uses to which
          the owner can put these resources.
        </p>
      </Definition>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-dark-100 mt-8 mb-4">Capitalism and Socialism Defined</h3>

      <Definition title="Capitalism">
        <p>
          A social system based on the natural position regarding property rights is called <strong>pure
          capitalism</strong> or a <strong>pure private law system</strong>. This system is based on
          the idea that to be nonaggressive, claims to property must be backed by the objective fact
          of an act of original appropriation, of previous ownership, or by a mutually beneficial
          contractual relationship.
        </p>
      </Definition>

      <Definition title="Socialism">
        <p>
          If this system is altered and a policy is instituted that assigns rights of exclusive control
          over scarce means to persons or groups of persons that can point neither to an act of previous
          usership of the things concerned, nor to a contractual relation with some previous user-owner,
          then this will be called <strong>(partial) socialism</strong>.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2">
          Socialism must be conceptualized as an <strong>institutionalized interference with or
          aggression against private property and private property claims</strong>.
        </p>
      </Definition>

      <Callout type="warning" title="Key Distinction">
        <p>
          The fundamental distinction between capitalism and socialism is not about planning versus
          no planning, nor about coordination versus chaos. Both systems must coordinate actions.
          The difference lies in <strong>how</strong> this coordination is achieved: capitalism
          coordinates by respecting previous user-ownership, while socialism coordinates by
          superimposing one person's or group's plan upon another, regardless of prior ownership
          and mutual exchange agreements.

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-dark-100 mt-8 mb-4">Consequences of Socialism</h3>

      <Theorem title="Two Fundamental Effects of Socialism">
        <p className="mb-2">
          The introduction of aggressively founded ownership produces two types of effects:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mt-2">
          <li>
            <strong>Economic effect:</strong> A reduction in the amount of investment. Since the
            natural owner can no longer decide on his own what uses to put his resources to, the
            value attached to them falls, leading to favoring consumption over investment decisions.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Social effect:</strong> A change in the character structure of society. Abandoning
            the natural theory of property implies a redistribution of income that favors invaders of
            others' property at the expense of those who use their own property without invading
            others'.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </Theorem>

      <p className="mb-4">
        These two effects—reduced investment and increased incentives for aggressive personality
        types—constitute the most fundamental reasons for socialism's being an economically inferior
        system of property arrangements.
      </p>

      <Callout type="success" title="Key Insight">
        <p>
          The natural theory of property provides both an economic foundation (explaining why
          capitalism produces greater wealth) and a moral foundation (explaining why capitalism
          is the only defensible system based on objective, universal principles rather than
          arbitrary verbal declarations).
