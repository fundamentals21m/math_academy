      The action axiom is apodictically certain—true by the nature of human thought itself.

      To argue against it, one must:
      1. Have a goal (refuting the axiom)
      2. Choose means (constructing arguments)
      3. Believe the argument can achieve the goal

      But this is precisely purposeful action. The denial proves the axiom.

      B's comparative advantage is in Y (1:5 = 1:5 ratio, same as A—so B should specialize in Y).

      To allocate resources rationally, one must know the relative values of different uses.

      Prices emerge only from voluntary exchange.

      Socialism abolishes private ownership of means of production.

      Without private ownership, there is no exchange of capital goods.

      Without exchange, there are no prices for capital goods.

      Without prices, there is no rational calculation.

      Therefore, socialism cannot calculate and must rely on arbitrary decisions.
