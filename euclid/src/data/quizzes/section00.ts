    question: 'According to Euclid, what is a point?',
    options: [
      'A breadthless length',
      'The intersection of two lines',
      'A location with coordinates',
      'That which has no part',
    ],
    correctIndex: 3,
    difficulty: 'easy',
    explanation: 'Definition 1 states: "A point is that which has no part." This means a point has no dimension—no length, width, or depth.',
  },

    id: 2,
    type: 'multiple-choice',
    question: 'What does Postulate 5 (the Parallel Postulate) state about two lines cut by a transversal?',
    options: [
      'They are always parallel',
      'They meet on the side where interior angles sum to less than two right angles',
      'They never meet',
      'They form equal alternate angles',
    ],
    correctIndex: 1,
    difficulty: 'medium',
    explanation: 'Postulate 5 states that if interior angles on one side sum to less than two right angles, the lines will meet on that side if extended.',
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    type: 'multiple-choice',
    question: 'Common Notion 1 states: "Things which are equal to the same thing are also..."',
    options: [
      'Greater than each other',
      'Parallel to each other',
      'Equal to one another',
      'Similar to each other',
    ],
    correctIndex: 2,
    difficulty: 'easy',
    explanation: 'Common Notion 1 establishes transitivity of equality: if A = C and B = C, then A = B.',
  },
  {
    id: 4,
    type: 'multiple-choice',
    question: 'According to Euclid\'s definitions, what is a right angle?',
    options: [
      'An angle of exactly 90 degrees',
      'Half of a straight angle',
      'The angle in a semicircle',
      'When a straight line standing on another makes adjacent angles equal to one another',
    ],
    correctIndex: 3,
    difficulty: 'medium',
    explanation: 'Definition 10: When a straight line standing on a straight line makes the adjacent angles equal, each is a right angle.',

    id: 5,
    type: 'multiple-choice',
    question: 'Which postulate allows us to draw a circle with any center and any radius?',
    options: [
      'Postulate 3',
      'Postulate 2',
      'Postulate 1',
      'Postulate 4',
    ],
    correctIndex: 0,
    difficulty: 'easy',
    explanation: 'Postulate 3: "To describe a circle with any centre and distance."',
  },
  {
    id: 6,
    type: 'multiple-choice',
    question: 'What does Common Notion 5 state?',
    options: [
      'Equals added to equals give equals',
      'The whole is greater than the part',
      'Equals subtracted from equals give equals',
      'Things equal to the same thing are equal to each other',
    ],
    correctIndex: 1,
    difficulty: 'easy',
    explanation: 'Common Notion 5: "The whole is greater than the part." This fundamental axiom underlies many geometric proofs.',
