    question: 'The "harvest of interventionism" includes:',
    options: [
      'Sustained prosperity',
      'Reduced inequality',
      'Stable mixed economies',
      'Wars, depressions, unemployment, capital consumption—exactly what economists predicted',
    ],
    correctIndex: 3,
    difficulty: 'easy',
    explanation: 'Interventionist policies have produced all the effects economists predicted: wars, oppression, depressions, unemployment, capital consumption, and famine. Yet advocates blame residual capitalism rather than their policies.',
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    type: 'multiple-choice',
    question: 'The "reserve fund" that interventionism treats as inexhaustible is:',
    options: [
      'The accumulated wealth of the affluent—which is actually finite and can be exhausted',
      'Government tax revenue',
      'Foreign aid',
      'Natural resources',
    ],
    correctIndex: 0,
    difficulty: 'medium',
    explanation: 'The fundamental idea of interventionism is that high incomes and accumulated wealth can be freely redistributed. But this fund is finite. It can no longer be applied once exhausted by taxes and other measures.',
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    type: 'multiple-choice',
    question: 'The interventionist spiral continues because:',
    options: [
      'Politicians are corrupt',
      'Markets naturally fail',
      'Each intervention creates problems requiring further intervention',
      'Technology changes',
    ],
    correctIndex: 2,
    difficulty: 'medium',
    explanation: 'Each intervention creates new problems that seem to require new interventions. Price controls cause shortages requiring rationing. Distortions spread. The spiral continues until comprehensive planning or market return.',
  },
  {
    id: 4,
    type: 'multiple-choice',
    question: 'Interventionism must eventually evolve toward:',
    options: [
      'A stable middle way',
      'Either market economy or full socialism—there is no permanent third option',
      'Technocratic rule',
      'Pure democracy',
    ],
    correctIndex: 1,
    difficulty: 'hard',
    explanation: 'The "middle way" of interventionism cannot be stable. It contains internal contradictions pushing it toward one extreme or the other. The choice can be postponed but not avoided.',
  },
  {
    id: 5,
    type: 'multiple-choice',
    question: 'When the reserve fund of accumulated capital is consumed:',
    options: [
      'The productive base shrinks, reducing future income available to redistribute',
      'New wealth automatically appears',
      'Government can create more through policy',
      'International trade compensates',
    ],
    correctIndex: 0,
    difficulty: 'medium',
    explanation: 'Lower capital means lower productivity, lower incomes, and less to redistribute—and less to consume. The interventionist system consumes the very wealth that sustains it.',
  },
  {
    id: 6,
    type: 'multiple-choice',
    question: 'Interventionists respond to the failures of intervention by:',
    options: [
      'Acknowledging their error',
      'Returning to market principles',
      'Blaming the residual capitalism not yet eliminated and prescribing more intervention',
      'Conducting rigorous empirical studies',
    ],
    correctIndex: 2,
    difficulty: 'easy',
    explanation: 'Advocates blame results not on their policies but on residual capitalism. Each failure becomes an argument for more intervention, until the entire system reaches its breaking point.',
  },
