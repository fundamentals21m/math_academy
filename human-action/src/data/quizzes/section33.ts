    question: 'Syndicalism seeks to replace "consumer democracy" with:',
    options: [
      '"Producer democracy"—letting workers in each industry decide production',
      'Central planning by experts',
      'Constitutional monarchy',
      'Direct consumer voting',
    ],
    correctIndex: 0,
    difficulty: 'medium',
    explanation: 'Syndicalism aims to let workers in each industry decide what and how to produce. But this inverts economic logic—the sole purpose of production is consumption. Making production an end in itself serves producer interests at consumer expense.',
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    type: 'multiple-choice',
    question: 'Syndicalist policies benefit:',
    options: [
      'All workers equally',
      'Consumers primarily',
      'Organized workers in strategic industries at the expense of the majority',
      'Society as a whole',
    ],
    correctIndex: 2,
    difficulty: 'easy',
    explanation: 'Syndicalist policies grant privileges to a minority of organized workers at the expense of the immense majority. The result is not worker solidarity but worker conflict—each group seeking monopoly privileges.',
  },

    type: 'multiple-choice',
    question: 'Guild socialism and corporativism fail because:',
    options: [
      'Workers refuse to participate',
      'Technology is insufficient',
      'Without market prices, autonomous guilds cannot rationally coordinate interdependent industries',
      'Government intervention is too weak',
    ],
    correctIndex: 2,
    difficulty: 'hard',
    explanation: 'No industry is truly autonomous. Steel depends on iron ore, autos depend on steel, everyone needs energy. Without market prices to coordinate these interdependencies, there is no rational basis for allocation.',
  },
  {
    id: 4,
    type: 'multiple-choice',
    question: 'The "autonomy fallacy" in corporativism is that:',
    options: [
      'Branches of production can be self-governing despite mutual dependence',
      'Workers want independence',
      'Governments claim too much power',
      'Markets are too efficient',
    ],
    correctIndex: 0,
    difficulty: 'medium',
    explanation: 'Under the division of labor, no industry stands alone. The claim that industries can be "autonomous" ignores that they all depend on each other for inputs and outputs.',
  },
  {
    id: 5,
    type: 'multiple-choice',
    question: 'In practice, corporativism must eventually revert to:',
    options: [
      'Pure market economy',
      'Outright socialism with central planning',
      'Constitutional democracy',
      'Feudalism',
    ],
    correctIndex: 1,
    difficulty: 'medium',
    explanation: 'When autonomous guilds cannot coordinate, central authority must step in. The more disputes arise, the more the center must direct. Eventually the guilds become mere administrative units of a centrally planned economy.',
  },
  {
    id: 6,
    type: 'multiple-choice',
    question: 'The deepest error of syndicalism is treating production as:',
    options: [
      'A means to satisfy consumer wants',
      'Government responsibility',
      'A collective activity',
      'An end in itself, inverting the proper relationship with consumption'
    ],
    correctIndex: 3,
    difficulty: 'hard',
    explanation: 'When production becomes an end rather than a means, things are turned upside down. Workers\' control sounds democratic but actually means organized producers imposing their preferences on consumers.',
  },
