    question: 'What transformed limited wars between royal armies into total war?',
    options: [
      'Advances in military technology alone',
      'Population growth',
      'The substitution of the welfare state for the laissez-faire state',
      'Religious differences',
    ],
    correctIndex: 2,
    difficulty: 'medium',
    explanation: 'What transformed limited war into total war was not military technology—it was the substitution of the welfare state for the laissez-faire state. When governments control economies, war becomes a clash of entire peoples.',

    type: 'multiple-choice',
    question: 'The market economy presupposes:',
    options: [
      'Peace—voluntary exchange rather than force',
      'Military preparedness',
      'Government direction',
      'Autarky',
    ],
    correctIndex: 0,
    difficulty: 'easy',
    explanation: 'The market economy rests on peaceful cooperation and voluntary exchange. War is its antithesis—substituting force for trade. The market "bursts asunder" when citizens turn into warriors.',

    id: 3,
    type: 'multiple-choice',
    question: 'Autarky (national self-sufficiency) intended to prepare for war actually:',
    options: [
      'Prevents war',
      'Has no effect on conflict',
      'Strengthens international cooperation',
      'Causes war—nations must seize what they cannot trade for',
    ],
    correctIndex: 3,
    difficulty: 'hard',
    explanation: 'The autarky trap: when nations cannot obtain resources through trade, they seek them through conquest. The same ideology that demands self-sufficiency justifies aggression to achieve it.',
  },

    id: 4,
    type: 'multiple-choice',
    question: 'Victory in war solves fundamental problems:',
    options: [
      'Never—unless underlying ideologies change, new conflicts must arise',
      'Permanently',
      'Only if territory is gained',
      'When international organizations enforce peace',
    ],
    correctIndex: 0,
    difficulty: 'medium',
    explanation: 'Defeating aggressors is not enough to make peace durable. Unless the underlying ideology changes, new conflicts must arise. Treaties and international organizations are powerless against the spirit of conquest.',
  },

    id: 5,
    type: 'multiple-choice',
    question: 'Durable peace requires:',
    options: [
      'Strong international bureaucracies',

      'Isolation of nations',
    ],
    correctIndex: 2,
    difficulty: 'medium',
    explanation: 'If the market economy principle is universally accepted, treaties are unnecessary. If it is not accepted, they are futile. Peace is the natural state when trade replaces conquest as the means of obtaining resources.',

      'Permanent security'
    ],
    correctIndex: 1,
    difficulty: 'easy',
    explanation: 'Philosophers recognize war\'s futility: people are killed, wealth destroyed, countries devastated—for the sole benefit of rulers. The individual citizen is not enriched when rulers expand their realm.',
