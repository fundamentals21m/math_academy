      'The substitution of the welfare state for the laissez-faire state',
    ],
    correctIndex: 3,
    difficulty: 'medium',
    explanation: 'What transformed limited war into total war was not military technology—it was the substitution of the welfare state for the laissez-faire state. When governments control economies, war becomes a clash of entire peoples.',

    ],
    correctIndex: 1,

      'Strengthens international cooperation',
    ],
    correctIndex: 2,
    difficulty: 'hard',
    explanation: 'The autarky trap: when nations cannot obtain resources through trade, they seek them through conquest. The same ideology that demands self-sufficiency justifies aggression to achieve it.',

    ],
    correctIndex: 0,
