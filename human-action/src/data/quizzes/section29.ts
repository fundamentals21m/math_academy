    question: 'The distinguishing feature of restriction as a form of intervention is that:',
    options: [
      'The diversion of production is precisely what the authority intends',
      'It generates government revenue',
      'It increases total output',
      'It benefits consumers',
    ],
    correctIndex: 0,
    difficulty: 'medium',
    explanation: 'Restriction means government "forbids or makes more difficult the production of definite articles." The diversion of production is not an unintended side effect—it is the purpose.',
  },

    id: 2,
    type: 'multiple-choice',
    question: 'Every restriction benefits:',
    options: [
      'Society as a whole',
      'Consumers primarily',
      'A concentrated group at the expense of the dispersed many',
      'Workers in all industries',
    ],
    correctIndex: 2,
    difficulty: 'easy',
    explanation: 'Restrictive action is advantageous for the privileged group and disadvantageous for those excluded. The winners are concentrated and organized; the losers are dispersed and unaware.',

    type: 'multiple-choice',
    question: 'When government "encourages" an industry through subsidies:',
    options: [
      'Total production increases',
      'Resources are withdrawn from other sectors, reducing their output',
      'Resources are created from nothing',
      'All industries benefit equally',
    ],
    correctIndex: 1,
    difficulty: 'medium',
    explanation: 'Government cannot create resources; it can only redirect them. Every subsidy to one sector withdraws resources from others. Citizens forgo valued satisfactions to obtain lesser ones.',
  },

    id: 4,
    type: 'multiple-choice',
    question: 'Restriction belongs to the sphere of:',
    options: [
      'Production—generating new wealth',
      'Scientific management',
      'Neutral policy',
      'Consumption—reducing what productive systems create',
    ],
    correctIndex: 3,
    difficulty: 'hard',
    explanation: 'Restrictions can only curtail output, never generate it. You cannot construct a system of economic action out of restrictive measures alone—they belong to consumption, not production.',
  },
  {
    id: 5,
    type: 'multiple-choice',
    question: 'Higher living standards for workers result from:',
    options: [
      'Capital accumulation and increased productivity',
      'Government mandates for shorter work hours',
      'Restriction of imports',
      'Licensing requirements',
    ],
    correctIndex: 0,
    difficulty: 'easy',
    explanation: 'Rising standards come from profit-seeking businesses accumulating and investing capital, not from restrictions or mandates. Higher productivity per hour, not fewer hours at the same productivity, creates wealth.',

    type: 'multiple-choice',
    question: 'Those seeking restrictions want to be:',
    options: [
      'Equal with others',
      'Privileged at others\\\' expense',
      'Subject to market discipline',
      'Accountable to consumers',
    ],
    correctIndex: 1,
    difficulty: 'medium',
    explanation: 'Those who advocate restrictions want to be privileged at others\' expense. The concentrated gains to the few are always less than the dispersed losses to the many.',
