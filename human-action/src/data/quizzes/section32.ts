    question: 'The confiscationist fallacy assumes that economic output is:',
    options: [
      'Determined by property rights and incentives',
      'Unlimited',
      'Dependent on government planning',
      'A fixed quantity independent of how it is distributed',
    ],
    correctIndex: 3,
    difficulty: 'medium',
    explanation: 'Confiscationists treat economic output like a fixed pie to be divided. But the pie\'s size depends on property rights—people produce and accumulate capital only when they expect to keep the fruits of their efforts.',

    type: 'multiple-choice',
    question: 'Land reform that breaks up large estates into small holdings:',
    options: [
      'Increases total agricultural output',
      'Benefits all workers equally',
      'Raises food prices and reduces total economic output',
      'Has no economic effects',
    ],
    correctIndex: 2,
    difficulty: 'medium',
    explanation: 'When more workers are required per unit of farm output (due to smaller, less efficient holdings), more people must work in agriculture and fewer remain for manufacturing. Total output decreases.',

    type: 'multiple-choice',
    question: 'Confiscatory taxation on capital ultimately harms:',
    options: [
      'Only the wealthy',
      'Workers, through slower capital accumulation and stagnant wages',
      'Government revenue',
      'Foreign investors only',
    ],
    correctIndex: 1,
    difficulty: 'hard',
    explanation: 'Lower capital accumulation means less productive equipment, slower technological progress, and stagnant wages. The policy claiming to help workers actually harms them by slowing the growth that raises living standards.',

    type: 'multiple-choice',
    question: 'Progressive taxation creates an asymmetry because:',
    options: [
      'Government shares heavily in profits but only partially in losses',

      'All risk is eliminated',
      'Investment returns are guaranteed',
    ],
    correctIndex: 0,
    difficulty: 'hard',
    explanation: 'An entrepreneur who succeeds may keep only a fraction of gains while absorbing most of the downside risk. This asymmetry particularly affects innovative ventures that drive economic progress.',
  },
  {
    id: 5,
    type: 'multiple-choice',
    question: 'Under confiscatory taxation, capital tends to flow toward:',
    options: [
      'Risky innovations that advance civilization',
      'Foreign markets exclusively',
      'Safe, established investments with predictable returns',
      'Consumer goods only',
    ],
    correctIndex: 2,
    difficulty: 'medium',
    explanation: 'High taxation makes the risk-reward ratio unfavorable for entrepreneurship. Capital gravitates toward bonds and established businesses. Society loses the dynamism of entrepreneurial risk-taking.',

    question: 'Confiscatory policies contain the seeds of their own failure because:',
    options: [
      'Politicians change their minds',
      'They consume the very wealth they seek to redistribute',
      'International pressure intervenes',
      'Technology makes them obsolete',
    ],
    correctIndex: 1,
    difficulty: 'easy',
    explanation: 'By attacking capital accumulation, confiscatory policies reduce the very wealth they seek to redistribute. Each round of expropriation leaves less to expropriate next time.',
