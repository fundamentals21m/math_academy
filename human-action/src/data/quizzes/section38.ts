      'A purely descriptive enterprise',
    ],
    correctIndex: 2,
    difficulty: 'medium',

    correctIndex: 3,
    difficulty: 'medium',
    explanation: 'The paramount role that economic ideas play in civic affairs explains why those in power want to propagandize the "good" doctrine and silence the "bad" ones. Truth threatens established arrangements.',
