    question: 'Socialism arose intellectually from:',
    options: [
      'Scientific analysis of economic data',
      'Worker uprisings in factories',
      'Imagining a perfect, all-knowing state that could plan better than markets',
      'Ancient philosophical traditions'
    ],
    correctIndex: 2,
    difficulty: 'medium',
    explanation: 'Socialism arose from attributing omniscience to an idealized state. Once the state was assumed to possess perfect knowledge, central planning appeared superior to the "anarchic" market.',

    type: 'multiple-choice',
    question: 'Marx\'s doctrine of "polylogism" claims that:',
    options: [
      'All logic is universal',
      'Different classes have fundamentally different logics',
      'Economics is purely mathematical',
      'Science can determine social goals',
    ],
    correctIndex: 1,
    difficulty: 'hard',
    explanation: 'Polylogism claims that bourgeois and proletarian minds work differently—that arguments against socialism merely reflect "bourgeois logic." This immunizes socialism from rational critique.',

    id: 3,
    type: 'multiple-choice',
    question: 'The crucial feature of socialism is that:',
    options: [
      'Workers own the means of production',
      'Wealth is distributed equally',
      'Markets are regulated',
      'All productive activities are directed by one will',
    ],
    correctIndex: 3,
    difficulty: 'medium',
    explanation: 'The praxeological character of socialism is that all production is directed by one will. But no single mind can possess the knowledge dispersed among millions of individuals.',
  },

    id: 4,
    type: 'multiple-choice',
    question: 'The claim that socialism\'s arrival is "historically inevitable" functions as:',
    options: [
      'A scientific prediction',
      'An empirical observation',
      'A quasi-religious prophecy requiring faith',
      'An economic law',
    ],
    correctIndex: 2,
    difficulty: 'medium',
    explanation: 'Historical inevitability is not scientific prediction but quasi-religious prophecy. History is made by human choices, not predetermined forces. This transforms socialism into faith, not analysis.',
  },

      'Socialism requires military force',
      'Elections are impossible under socialism',
    ],
    correctIndex: 0,
    difficulty: 'hard',
    explanation: 'Every socialist imagines the planned economy will implement their vision. But since people have different values, someone must decide—and that someone becomes the dictator, regardless of intentions.',

      'Technology is insufficient',
      'People are selfish',
      'No entity possesses the knowledge dispersed among millions of individuals'
    ],
    correctIndex: 3,
    difficulty: 'medium',
    explanation: 'The pretense of omniscience is the fundamental socialist illusion. Central planners cannot know what individuals know about local conditions, preferences, and opportunities.',
