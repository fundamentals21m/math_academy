    question: 'Socialism arose intellectually from:',
    options: [
      'Scientific analysis of economic data',
      'Imagining a perfect, all-knowing state that could plan better than markets',
      'Worker uprisings in factories',
      'Ancient philosophical traditions',
    ],
    correctIndex: 1,
    difficulty: 'medium',
    explanation: 'Socialism arose from attributing omniscience to an idealized state. Once the state was assumed to possess perfect knowledge, central planning appeared superior to the "anarchic" market.',

    type: 'multiple-choice',
    question: 'Marx\'s doctrine of "polylogism" claims that:',
    options: [
      'All logic is universal',
      'Economics is purely mathematical',
      'Different classes have fundamentally different logics',
      'Science can determine social goals',
    ],
    correctIndex: 2,
    difficulty: 'hard',
    explanation: 'Polylogism claims that bourgeois and proletarian minds work differently—that arguments against socialism merely reflect "bourgeois logic." This immunizes socialism from rational critique.',
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    type: 'multiple-choice',
    question: 'The crucial feature of socialism is that:',
    options: [
      'All productive activities are directed by one will',
      'Workers own the means of production',
      'Wealth is distributed equally',
      'Markets are regulated',
    ],
    correctIndex: 0,
    difficulty: 'medium',
    explanation: 'The praxeological character of socialism is that all production is directed by one will. But no single mind can possess the knowledge dispersed among millions of individuals.',
  },
  {
    id: 4,
    type: 'multiple-choice',
    question: 'The claim that socialism\'s arrival is "historically inevitable" functions as:',
    options: [
      'A scientific prediction',
      'An empirical observation',
      'An economic law',
      'A quasi-religious prophecy requiring faith',
    ],
    correctIndex: 3,
    difficulty: 'medium',
    explanation: 'Historical inevitability is not scientific prediction but quasi-religious prophecy. History is made by human choices, not predetermined forces. This transforms socialism into faith, not analysis.',

      'Socialism requires military force',
      'Elections are impossible under socialism',
    ],
    correctIndex: 1,
    difficulty: 'hard',
    explanation: 'Every socialist imagines the planned economy will implement their vision. But since people have different values, someone must decide—and that someone becomes the dictator, regardless of intentions.',

      'Technology is insufficient',
      'No entity possesses the knowledge dispersed among millions of individuals',
      'People are selfish',
    ],
    correctIndex: 2,
    difficulty: 'medium',
    explanation: 'The pretense of omniscience is the fundamental socialist illusion. Central planners cannot know what individuals know about local conditions, preferences, and opportunities.',
