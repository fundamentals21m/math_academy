    question: 'Capitalism\'s relationship to poverty is that it:',
    options: [
      'Inherited universal poverty and has steadily reduced it',
      'Created poverty where none existed',
      'Has no effect on poverty levels',
      'Increases poverty over time',
    ],
    correctIndex: 0,
    difficulty: 'easy',
    explanation: 'Poverty is the original condition of humanity. For millennia, the vast majority lived at bare subsistence. Capitalism inherited this universal poverty and has reduced extreme poverty from 90% to under 10%.',

    id: 2,
    type: 'multiple-choice',
    question: 'Inequality in the market economy:',
    options: [
      'Is a defect to be corrected',
      'Has no economic function',
      'Is the mechanism enabling capital accumulation and rising living standards',
      'Benefits only the wealthy',
    ],
    correctIndex: 2,
    difficulty: 'medium',
    explanation: 'Inequality allows some to save and invest. This drives capital accumulation, which raises productivity and wages for all. Attempts to enforce equality destroy the incentives that create wealth.',

    type: 'multiple-choice',
    question: 'Market "insecurity" (businesses failing, jobs lost) reflects:',
    options: [
      'Market failure',

      'Economic dynamism—resources shifting to more valued uses',
    ],
    correctIndex: 3,
    difficulty: 'medium',
    explanation: 'This "insecurity" is consumer sovereignty in action. Resources constantly shift toward more valued uses because consumers have found something better. A stagnant economy without such changes would be "secure" only in its poverty.',

      'Justifies any intervention',
      'Has universal meaning',
    ],
    correctIndex: 0,
    difficulty: 'hard',
    explanation: 'Interpreted broadly, "welfare" becomes the fundamental category of all human action—removing uneasiness. The market already serves this. Specific definitions smuggle in particular value judgments.',

      'Creating too much equality',
    ],
    correctIndex: 1,
    difficulty: 'medium',
    explanation: 'High taxes reduce funds available for charity. Regulations prevent low-skilled workers from finding jobs. Minimum wages price the poorest out of the labor market entirely.',

      'Human nature',
      'Technological progress',
    ],
    correctIndex: 1,
    difficulty: 'hard',
    explanation: 'The objections are based on bad economics. Critics blame the market for consequences of the very anti-capitalistic policies they advocate. They fix on the market the responsibility for the inevitable failure of interventionism.',
