    options: [
      'A series of stages from higher-order goods to consumer goods',
      'A single stage from raw materials to consumer goods',
      'Random production processes',
      'Government-planned production sequences',

    correctIndex: 0,
    difficulty: 'medium',
    explanation: 'Production moves through stages: from raw materials (higher-order goods) through intermediate stages to final consumer goods.',

      'Goods used to produce other goods',
    ],

    question: 'What is capital in the Austrian view?',
    options: [

      'Previously produced goods used to produce future goods',

    type: 'multiple-choice',
    question: 'Why is production time-consuming?',
    options: [
      'Workers are slow',
      'Production requires going through multiple stages of transformation',
      'There is no reason—production can be instantaneous',
      'Government regulations slow it down',
    ],
    correctIndex: 1,
    difficulty: 'easy',
    explanation: 'Production takes time because goods must pass through various stages of transformation before becoming consumer goods.',

    id: 5,
    type: 'multiple-choice',
    question: 'What determines the value of producer goods (factors of production)?',
    options: [
      'Government assessment',
      'Their cost of production',
      'The value of the consumer goods they help produce',
      'Their weight and size',
    ],
    correctIndex: 2,
    difficulty: 'medium',
    explanation: 'Producer goods derive their value from the consumer goods they help create. Value flows backward from consumption.',

    type: 'multiple-choice',
    question: 'According to Rothbard, what happens when capital is consumed rather than maintained?',
    options: [
      'Nothing significant',
      'Future production capacity decreases',
      'Prices immediately fall',
      'Workers become unemployed instantly',
    ],
    correctIndex: 1,
    difficulty: 'hard',
    explanation: 'Consuming capital (not replacing worn-out equipment) reduces future productive capacity, lowering future living standards.',
