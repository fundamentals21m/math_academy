**Part (a): Trichotomy.** Let x = LIM_{n→∞}aₙ for some Cauchy sequence (aₙ). If (aₙ) is equivalent to (0), then x = 0. Otherwise, by Lemma 5.3.14, x can be written as a formal limit of a sequence bounded away from zero. Such a sequence must be either positively bounded away from zero (making x positive) or negatively bounded away from zero (making x negative), but not both.

To show mutual exclusivity: if x is both positive and zero, then x = LIM_{n→∞}bₙ for some positively bounded sequence (bₙ), but also x = 0. This means (bₙ) is equivalent to (0), contradicting that (bₙ) is positively bounded away from zero. Similar reasoning rules out the other overlaps.

**Part (b): Negation.** If x is negative, then x = LIM_{n→∞}aₙ where aₙ ≤ -c for all n ≥ 1. Then -x = LIM_{n→∞}(-aₙ) where -aₙ ≥ c > 0 for all n ≥ 1, so -x is positive. The converse is similar.

**Part (c): Closure under addition.** If x and y are positive, write x = LIM_{n→∞}aₙ and y = LIM_{n→∞}bₙ where aₙ ≥ c and bₙ ≥ d for positive rationals c, d. Then aₙ + bₙ ≥ c + d > 0 for all n, so (aₙ + bₙ) is positively bounded away from zero, hence x + y is positive.

**Part (d): Closure under multiplication.** If x and y are positive with aₙ ≥ c > 0 and bₙ ≥ d > 0, then aₙbₙ ≥ cd > 0 for all n, so (aₙbₙ) is positively bounded away from zero, hence xy is positive. □`,children:[e.jsxs("p",{className:"mb-2",children:["For every real number ",e.jsx(s,{children:"x"}),", exactly one of the following three statements is true:"]}),e.jsxs("ol",{className:"list-decimal list-inside space-y-1 ml-4 mb-4",children:[e.jsxs("li",{children:[e.jsx(s,{children:"x"})," is zero"]}),e.jsxs("li",{children:[e.jsx(s,{children:"x"})," is positive"]}),e.jsxs("li",{children:[e.jsx(s,{children:"x"})," is negative"]})]}),e.jsx("p",{className:"mb-2",children:"Furthermore:"}),e.jsxs("ul",{className:"list-disc list-inside space-y-1 ml-4",children:[e.jsxs("li",{children:["A real number ",e.jsx(s,{children:"x"})," is negative if and only if ",e.jsx(s,{children:"-x"})," is positive."]}),e.jsxs("li",{children:["If ",e.jsx(s,{children:"x"})," and ",e.jsx(s,{children:"y"})," are positive, then so are ",e.jsx(s,{children:"x + y"})," and ",e.jsx(s,{children:"xy"}),"."]})]})]}),e.jsx(i,{type:"info",title:"Trichotomy Law",children:e.jsxs("p",{children:["This is the ",e.jsx("strong",{children:"trichotomy property"})," for real numbers: every real is exactly one of positive, negative, or zero.
