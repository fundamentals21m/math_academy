    correctIndex: 1,
    difficulty: 'medium',
    explanation: 'In high dimensions, neighbors are far away and not truly "similar," degrading KNN performance.',

    id: 's10-m03',
    type: 'multiple-choice',
    question: 'Why might linear regression outperform KNN even when the relationship is slightly non-linear?',
    options: [
      'Linear regression is always better',
      'KNN cannot handle non-linearity',
      'Linear regression\\\'s lower variance can offset its higher bias',
      'KNN requires normally distributed data',

    correctIndex: 2,
    difficulty: 'medium',
    explanation: 'The bias-variance tradeoff: a small increase in bias from assuming linearity may be offset by reduced variance.',

    question: 'KNN is most appropriate when:',
    options: [
      '$p$ is small and the relationship is non-linear',

    question: 'To capture 10% of data as neighbors in 10 dimensions, approximately what fraction of each dimension\'s range is needed? (Enter as decimal, e.g., 0.79)',
    correctAnswer: 0.79,
    numericRange: { min: 0.5, max: 1, precision: 2 },
    difficulty: 'medium',
    explanation: 'To get 10% of points: need $(\\text{fraction})^{10} = 0.10$, so fraction = $0.10^{1/10} \\approx 0.79$ of each dimension.',

    type: 'multiple-choice',
    question: 'In the curse of dimensionality, as $p$ increases:',
    options: [
      'All points become equidistant from each other',
      'The nearest neighbors become relatively farther away',
      'Linear regression fails completely',
      'KNN predictions become more accurate',

    correctIndex: 1,
    difficulty: 'hard',
    explanation: 'In high dimensions, distances become less meaningful - even nearest neighbors are relatively far away.',

    question: 'Linear regression uses how many parameters regardless of sample size $n$?',

      '$p + 1$ parameters',

    question: 'KNN is called a "memory-based" or "instance-based" method because:',
    options: [
      'It requires large computer memory',
      'It stores training data and uses it directly for predictions',
      'It memorizes the test data',
      'It has poor memory of past predictions',
    ],
    correctIndex: 1,
    difficulty: 'hard',
    explanation: 'KNN doesn\'t fit parameters; it stores all training data and queries it to make each prediction.',

    type: 'multiple-choice',
    question: 'When comparing methods on simulated data, KNN-1 outperformed linear regression only when:',

      'The relationship was linear',

    explanation: 'KNN-1 (most flexible) only wins decisively when the true relationship is substantially non-linear, where linear regression\'s bias hurts.',
