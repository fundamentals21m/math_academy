If R is a Noetherian ring, then R[x] is Noetherian.

**Proof:**

Let I ⊆ R[x] be an ideal. We show I is finitely generated.

For n ≥ 0, let Iₙ = {leading coefficients of degree-n polynomials in I} ∪ {0}.

Each Iₙ is an ideal of R, and I₀ ⊆ I₁ ⊆ I₂ ⊆ ...

Let J = ∪ₙ Iₙ. This is an ideal of R.

Since R is Noetherian, J = (a₁, ..., aₘ) for some aᵢ ∈ R.

Each aᵢ ∈ Iₙᵢ for some nᵢ. Let N = max(nᵢ).

For each aᵢ, pick fᵢ ∈ I with leading coefficient aᵢ and deg(fᵢ) = nᵢ.

Also, each I₀, ..., I_{N-1} is finitely generated. Pick generators.

**Claim:** I is generated by {fᵢ} and the generators of I₀, ..., I_{N-1}.

Proof by induction on degree: Any f ∈ I can be reduced using these generators.`}],exercises:[{id:"15.1.1",type:"exercise",title:"Exercise 15.1.1",statement:"Prove that a ring R is Noetherian iff every ideal is finitely generated.",solution:`**Proof:**

**(⟹) Noetherian implies ideals are f.g.:**

Let I be an ideal of R and suppose I is not finitely generated.

Pick a₁ ∈ I. Then (a₁) ⊊ I.
Pick a₂ ∈ I \\ (a₁). Then (a₁) ⊊ (a₁, a₂) ⊊ I.
Continue: (a₁) ⊊ (a₁, a₂) ⊊ (a₁, a₂, a₃) ⊊ ...

This is a strictly ascending chain of ideals, contradicting Noetherian.

**(⟸) Ideals f.g. implies Noetherian:**

Let I₁ ⊆ I₂ ⊆ I₃ ⊆ ... be an ascending chain.

Let I = ∪ₙ Iₙ. This is an ideal.

By assumption, I = (a₁, ..., aₖ) for some aᵢ.

Each aᵢ ∈ Iₙᵢ. Let N = max(nᵢ).

Then a₁, ..., aₖ ∈ I_N, so I ⊆ I_N.

But I_N ⊆ I, so I = I_N.

For n ≥ N: Iₙ = I_N.

The chain stabilizes.`}]}],i={partId:15,partTitle:e,textbookChapter:n,sections:a};export{i as p};
