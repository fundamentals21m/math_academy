For any a, b ∈ ℤ:
φ(a + b) = (a + b) mod n

By properties of modular arithmetic:
(a + b) mod n = ((a mod n) + (b mod n)) mod n

In ℤ_n, addition is defined so that:
φ(a) + φ(b) = (a mod n) + (b mod n) = (a + b) mod n = φ(a + b)

Thus φ preserves the group operation.

**Step 2: Show φ is surjective.**

For any [k] ∈ ℤ_n where 0 ≤ k < n, we have φ(k) = k mod n = [k].

Since every element of ℤ_n can be written as [k] for some 0 ≤ k < n, φ is surjective.

**Step 3: Find ker(φ).**

ker(φ) = {a ∈ ℤ : φ(a) = [0]}

N = A_3 has index 2 in S_3 (since |S_3| = 6 and |A_3| = 3). Any subgroup of index 2 is normal.

Alternatively, A_3 is the kernel of the sign homomorphism sgn: S_3 → {±1}, so it's normal.

Since [G : N] = 2, there are exactly 2 cosets:
- N = {1, (1 2 3), (1 3 2)} (the even permutations)
- (1 2)N = {(1 2), (1 3), (2 3)} (the odd permutations)

G/N = {N, (1 2)N} has exactly 2 elements.

The multiplication table:
- N · N = N
- N · (1 2)N = (1 2)N
- (1 2)N · N = (1 2)N

φ(ab) = φ(a)φ(b) ∈ E (since E is closed under multiplication).

Let g ∈ G and let xyx⁻¹y⁻¹ be a generator of G'. We compute:

g(xyx⁻¹y⁻¹)g⁻¹ = (gxg⁻¹)(gyg⁻¹)(gx⁻¹g⁻¹)(gy⁻¹g⁻¹)
= (gxg⁻¹)(gyg⁻¹)(gxg⁻¹)⁻¹(gyg⁻¹)⁻¹

This is a commutator of gxg⁻¹ and gyg⁻¹, so it's in G'.

Since conjugation by g sends generators of G' to elements of G', and G' is generated by these commutators, we have gG'g⁻¹ ⊆ G' for all g ∈ G.

Thus G' ◁ G.

**Part 2: G/G' is abelian.**

For any aG', bG' ∈ G/G', we need to show (aG')(bG') = (bG')(aG').

This is equivalent to showing aba⁻¹b⁻¹ ∈ G'.

But aba⁻¹b⁻¹ is exactly a commutator, which is in G' by definition.

Therefore (aG')(bG') = abG' = ba(aba⁻¹b⁻¹)⁻¹G' = baG' = (bG')(aG').

So G/G' is abelian.

Assume G/Z(G) = ⟨gZ(G)⟩ is cyclic for some g ∈ G.

Let a, b ∈ G be arbitrary. We'll show ab = ba.

- b = g^n z₂ for some z₂ ∈ Z(G)

Now compute:
ab = (g^m z₁)(g^n z₂)

= g^{m+n} z₁ z₂

ba = (g^n z₂)(g^m z₁)
= g^n g^m z₂ z₁  (since z₂ commutes with everything)
= g^{n+m} z₂ z₁

Assume H ∪ K is a subgroup and suppose neither H ⊆ K nor K ⊆ H.

H ∩ K is a subgroup of both H and K.

By Lagrange's theorem:
- |H ∩ K| divides |H|
- |H ∩ K| divides |K|

Therefore |H ∩ K| divides gcd(|H|, |K|).

Since |H| and |K| are relatively prime, gcd(|H|, |K|) = 1.

Thus |H ∩ K| divides 1, which means |H ∩ K| = 1.

Since H ∩ K is a subgroup, it contains the identity e.

Claim: The cosets gᵢkⱼH for i ∈ {1,...,m}, j ∈ {1,...,n} are exactly the distinct left cosets of H in G.

**These cosets cover G:**
Any g ∈ G lies in some gᵢK, so g = gᵢk for some k ∈ K.
That k lies in some kⱼH, so k = kⱼh for some h ∈ H.
Thus g = gᵢkⱼh ∈ gᵢkⱼH.

**These cosets are distinct:**
Suppose gᵢkⱼH = gₚkᵧH.
Then gᵢkⱼ and gₚkᵧ are in the same coset of H, so gᵢkⱼ(gₚkᵧ)⁻¹ ∈ H ⊆ K.
This means gᵢkⱼkᵧ⁻¹gₚ⁻¹ ∈ K, so gᵢK = gₚK, giving i = p.
Then kⱼH = kᵧH, so j = q.

We already know ker(φ) ◁ G (proved earlier).

Define ψ: G/ker(φ) → φ(G) by ψ(g ker(φ)) = φ(g).

**Step 1: ψ is well-defined.**

If g₁ ker(φ) = g₂ ker(φ), then g₁⁻¹g₂ ∈ ker(φ).

**Part 1: HN ≤ G.**

HN = {hn : h ∈ H, n ∈ N}.

Identity: e = e·e ∈ HN.

Closure: (h₁n₁)(h₂n₂) = h₁(n₁h₂)n₂.
Since N ◁ G, n₁h₂ = h₂n' for some n' ∈ N.

p ≡ 1 (mod q) means q | (p - 1), so q ≤ p - 1 < p.

But then p² = 4 and p² ≡ 1 (mod 3) checks out (4 ≡ 1 mod 3).

However, in this specific case (|G| = 12), we can verify directly:
n_3 = 4 would mean 8 elements of order 3, leaving only 4 elements.
But we also need a Sylow 2-subgroup of order 4, contradiction.

**Conclusion:**

In all cases, n_q = 1, so there is a unique (hence normal) Sylow q-subgroup.`}]},{sectionId:"3.5",sectionTitle:"Transpositions and the Alternating Group",textbookSection:"§3.5",examples:[{id:"ex-3.5.1",type:"example",title:"Example 3.5.1",statement:"Express (1 2 3 4 5) as a product of transpositions and determine its sign.",solution:`**Step 1: Express as transpositions.**

(1 2 3 4 5) = (1 5)(1 4)(1 3)(1 2)

Verification:
Start with 1: 1 → 2 → 2 (after (1 2))
Then: 2 → 3 → 3 (after (1 3))
But (1 2 3 4 5) sends 1 → 2, 2 → 3, etc.

Let's verify more carefully:
(1 2)(1 3)(1 4)(1 5) acting on 1:
1 →^{(1 5)} 5 →^{(1 4)} 5 →^{(1 3)} 5 →^{(1 2)} 5

Actually the correct formula is:
(1 2 3 4 5) = (1 2)(2 3)(3 4)(4 5)

Or equivalently:
(1 2 3 4 5) = (1 5)(1 4)(1 3)(1 2)

**Step 2: Count transpositions.**

We used 4 transpositions.

**Step 3: Determine sign.**

Sign = (-1)^(number of transpositions) = (-1)^4 = 1.

**Alternative formula:**
For an n-cycle: sign = (-1)^(n-1).

For a 5-cycle: sign = (-1)^4 = 1 (even).

Therefore (1 2 3 4 5) ∈ A_5.`}],exercises:[{id:"3.5.1",type:"exercise",title:"Exercise 3.5.1",statement:"Prove that an n-cycle is an even permutation if and only if n is odd.",solution:`**Proof:**

An n-cycle (a₁ a₂ ... aₙ) can be written as:
(a₁ a₂ ... aₙ) = (a₁ aₙ)(a₁ aₙ₋₁)...(a₁ a₃)(a₁ a₂)

This is a product of (n - 1) transpositions.

The sign of the permutation is (-1)^(n-1).

**Case n odd:**
n - 1 is even, so sign = (-1)^(even) = 1.
The cycle is even.

**Case n even:**
n - 1 is odd, so sign = (-1)^(odd) = -1.
The cycle is odd.

Therefore: n-cycle is even ⟺ n is odd.`},{id:"3.5.2",type:"exercise",title:"Exercise 3.5.2",statement:"Prove that A_n is generated by 3-cycles for n ≥ 3.",solution:`**Proof:**

Every element of A_n is an even permutation, hence a product of an even number of transpositions.

It suffices to show that any product of two transpositions can be written as a product of 3-cycles.

**Case 1: Disjoint transpositions.**
(a b)(c d) where {a,b} ∩ {c,d} = ∅.

(a b)(c d) = (a b)(a c)(a c)(c d) = (a c b)(a c d)

(Note: (a c b) = (a b)(a c) and (a c d) = (a c)(c d))

**Case 2: Transpositions with one common element.**
(a b)(a c) = (a c b)

This is already a 3-cycle.

**Case 3: Identical transpositions.**
(a b)(a b) = identity

The identity is the empty product of 3-cycles.

Since every even permutation is a product of pairs of transpositions, and each pair can be written as a product of 3-cycles, A_n is generated by 3-cycles.`}]}],o={partId:3,partTitle:e,textbookChapter:n,sections:t};export{o as p};
