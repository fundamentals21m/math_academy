    question: 'In Year 1 of the tontine example with 100 members, $10M pool, and 4% return, the payout per survivor (with 99 survivors) is approximately:',
    options: [
      '$4,040',
      '$4,000',
      '$10,000',
      '$40,000',
    ],
    correctIndex: 0,
    difficulty: 'easy',
    explanation: 'Investment income = $10,000,000 × 0.04 = $400,000. Divided by 99 survivors = $4,040 per person.',

    question: 'By Year 20 (age 85) in the example, payouts have approximately:',
    options: [
      'Stayed constant at 4%',
      'Doubled to 8%',
      'Tripled to around 12.7%',
      'Decreased to 2%',
    ],
    correctIndex: 2,
    difficulty: 'medium',
    explanation: 'By Year 20, with about 50 survivors and pool growth from mortality credits, payouts reach approximately $12,700—about 12.7%, roughly triple the initial payout.',

    type: 'multiple-choice',
    question: 'Tontine payouts grow for two main reasons:',
    options: [
      'Fewer survivors to share with and pool growth from deceased members\\\\' capital',
      'Administrative cost reductions over time',
      'Inflation and interest rate increases',
      'Government subsidies and tax benefits',
    ],
    correctIndex: 0,
    difficulty: 'medium',
    explanation: 'Payouts grow because: (1) fewer survivors means fewer people sharing the pool, and (2) deceased members\' capital remains in the pool, growing the total.',

    type: 'multiple-choice',
    question: 'In Year 30 of the example (age 95), with only 12 survivors, the approximate yield on the original contribution is:',
    options: [
      '12%',
      '48%',
      '24%',
      '36%',
    ],
    correctIndex: 1,
    difficulty: 'hard',
    explanation: 'By Year 30 with only 12 survivors, the payout reaches approximately $48,000 per person—48% of the original $100,000 contribution.',

    type: 'multiple-choice',
    question: 'The payout per survivor $D_t$ is calculated as:',
    options: [
      'Pool value times interest rate',
      'Contribution times years elapsed',
      'Interest rate divided by deaths',
      'Investment income divided by number of survivors',
    ],
    correctIndex: 3,
    difficulty: 'easy',
    explanation: 'D_t = Investment income / n_t. The total investment income from the pool is divided equally among survivors.',

    question: 'The exponentially growing payouts in a classic tontine are described as:',
    options: [
      'A pure benefit with no drawbacks',
      'Impossible due to regulations',
      'A feature and a problem that needs addressing',
      'Only theoretical, never observed in practice',
    ],
    correctIndex: 2,
    difficulty: 'medium',
    explanation: 'Exponentially growing payouts are both a feature (high returns for survivors) and a problem (unpredictable income, perverse incentives) that modern tontine designs address.',
