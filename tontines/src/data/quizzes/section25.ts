    question: 'Risk-neutral investors ($\\gamma \\to 0$) prefer:',
    options: [
      'Flat payouts',
      'Rapidly growing payouts that maximize expected wealth',
      'Declining payouts',
      'Random payouts',
    ],
    correctIndex: 1,
    difficulty: 'easy',
    explanation: 'Risk-neutral investors care only about expected value, not variance. They prefer to maximize expected wealth, accepting volatility—the classic tontine\'s explosive growth is closer to optimal for them.',

    id: 2,
    type: 'multiple-choice',
    question: 'For moderate risk aversion ($\\gamma = 1-3$), the natural tontine achieves efficiency of:',
    options: [
      '75-80%',
      '85-90%',
      '100%',
      '97-99.5%',
    ],
    correctIndex: 3,
    difficulty: 'medium',
    explanation: 'For most people (γ = 1-3), the natural tontine captures 97-99.5% of optimal utility—nearly perfect.',

    question: 'Extremely risk-averse investors ($\\gamma \\to \\infty$) prefer:',
    options: [
      'Declining payouts',
      'Explosive payout growth',
      'Smooth, predictable growth',
      'Flat (constant) payouts',
    ],
    correctIndex: 3,
    difficulty: 'medium',
    explanation: 'Highly risk-averse investors want perfectly stable consumption—flat payouts with no volatility preferred.',

    type: 'multiple-choice',
    question: 'Lorenzo Tonti\'s original 1653 design (equal shares of income) is mathematically optimal for:',
    options: [
      'Extremely risk-averse investors',
      'Risk-neutral investors',
      'Log utility investors',
      'All investors equally',
    ],
    correctIndex: 0,
    difficulty: 'hard',
    explanation: 'Tonti\'s original design—equal shares of investment income split among survivors—is optimal for extremely risk-averse investors who want flat payouts.',
  },

    id: 5,
    type: 'multiple-choice',
    question: 'The natural tontine works well for all risk types because:',
    options: [
      'It perfectly matches every preference',
      'It\\\'s a good compromise—"approximately right" for everyone',
      'Government regulations require it',
      'It eliminates all risk',
    ],
    correctIndex: 1,
    difficulty: 'easy',
    explanation: 'The natural tontine is 92-99% efficient across all risk aversions—a remarkable compromise that works well regardless of individual preferences.',

  {
    id: 6,
    type: 'multiple-choice',
    question: 'The surprising historical connection is that:',
    options: [
      'Modern utility theory was invented for tontines',
      'Tontines were banned because of utility theory',
      'Tonti\\\\\'s 1653 intuition anticipated utility theory by 350 years',
      'Utility theory disproves tontines',
    ],
    correctIndex: 2,
    difficulty: 'hard',
    explanation: 'Tonti designed his tontine without knowledge of utility theory, yet his design is mathematically optimal for extremely risk-averse investors—intuition anticipated mathematics by 350 years.',
