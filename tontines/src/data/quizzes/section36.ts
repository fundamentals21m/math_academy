      'Immutable records',
      'Automatic payouts executed by code',
      'Transparent tracking of balances',
      'Guaranteed returns',
    ],

    difficulty: 'easy',
    explanation: 'Smart contract tontines provide automatic payouts, transparency, and immutability—but NOT guaranteed returns (no system can guarantee that).',

    question: 'The "oracle problem" for blockchain tontines refers to:',
    options: [
      'Predicting the future',
      'How the smart contract knows when a member has died',
      'Calculating mortality rates',
      'Setting investment returns',
    ],
    correctIndex: 1,
    difficulty: 'medium',
    explanation: 'The oracle problem is how blockchains access real-world data—specifically, how to reliably report deaths without creating fraud opportunities.',

    type: 'multiple-choice',
    question: 'Which is NOT a proposed solution to the oracle problem?',
    options: [
      'Government death registries',
      'Proof-of-life systems',
      'Guaranteeing no one dies',
      'Decentralized oracle networks',
    ],
    correctIndex: 2,
    difficulty: 'easy',
    explanation: 'Solutions include government registries, proof-of-life systems, decentralized oracles, and social verification—but you cannot guarantee no one dies.',

    id: 4,
    type: 'multiple-choice',
    question: 'In the mortality credit distribution example, if a member with $120k dies and three survivors hold $100k, $150k, and $250k respectively, Member C receives:',
    options: [
      '$24k',
      '$36k',
      '$60k',
      '$120k',
    ],
    correctIndex: 2,
    difficulty: 'hard',
    explanation: 'Member C: $120k × ($250k/$500k) = $120k × 0.5 = $60k. Distribution is proportional to existing stakes.',

    id: 5,
    type: 'multiple-choice',
    question: 'A key challenge for blockchain tontines is "gas costs." These can be addressed by:',
    options: [
      'Government subsidies',
      'Layer 2 solutions or alternative chains',
      'Using more expensive blockchains',
      'Eliminating all transactions',
    ],
    correctIndex: 1,
    difficulty: 'medium',
    explanation: 'High Ethereum gas costs can be addressed through Layer 2 solutions (rollups, sidechains) or using alternative blockchains with lower fees.',

    id: 6,
    type: 'multiple-choice',
    question: 'Blockchain tontines eliminate which type of risk?',
    options: [
      'Intermediary/counterparty risk',
      'Investment risk',
      'Mortality risk',
      'All risks',
    ],
    correctIndex: 0,
    difficulty: 'hard',
    explanation: 'Smart contracts eliminate intermediary risk—no insurance company can fail, no manager can embezzle. Investment and mortality risks remain.',
