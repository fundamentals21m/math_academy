    question: 'In the example, the last survivor (at age 105) could receive approximately how much per year?',

    question: 'Mathematically, payouts in a classic tontine grow as:',
    options: [
      'Proportional to time elapsed',
      'Proportional to $1/n$ where $n$ is survivors',
      'Constant regardless of survivors',
      'Proportional to $n^2

    difficulty: 'medium',
    explanation: 'Payout D_t ∝ 1/n_t. As the number of survivors approaches 1, payouts explode toward infinity.',

    id: 3,
    type: 'multiple-choice',
    question: 'The classic tontine\'s payout profile is problematic for retirement because:',
    options: [
      'Inflation adjustments are mandatory',
      'Payouts are too low overall',
      'Early retirees get modest payouts while late survivors get enormous amounts they may not need',
      'Payouts are guaranteed to decrease',
    ],
    correctIndex: 2,
    difficulty: 'hard',
    explanation: 'Active retirees in their 60s-70s get modest payouts when they might want to travel. Late survivors in their 90s+ get enormous payouts when they may have limited ability to spend.',

    question: 'Which is NOT a problem with the classic tontine design?',
    options: [
      'The initial contribution amount',
      'Wildly variable payouts make financial planning impossible',
      'Perverse incentives regarding other members\\\\\' deaths',
      'Gambling-like characteristics',
    ],
    correctIndex: 0,
    difficulty: 'easy',
    explanation: 'The initial contribution amount is not a design problem—it\'s simply a parameter. The problems are payout variability, perverse incentives, and gambling characteristics.',

    type: 'multiple-choice',
    question: 'Historical tontines gained a bad reputation partly due to:',
    options: [
      'Real and imagined incentives for murder of other members',

      'Mathematical impossibility of the concept',

    difficulty: 'medium',
    explanation: 'The fewer survivors, the more each gets—creating real and imagined incentives for murder that fueled tontines\' negative reputation.',

    question: 'Modern tontine designs aim to eliminate all of the following EXCEPT:',

      'Optimal consumption profiles',
      'Investment returns',
    ],
    correctIndex: 3,
    difficulty: 'easy',
    explanation: 'Modern tontines still include investment returns—that\'s part of how they work. They aim for smooth payouts, no jackpot, and optimal consumption, addressing classic design flaws.',
