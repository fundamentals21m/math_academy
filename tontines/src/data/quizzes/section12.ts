    question: 'A financial contract is actuarially fair if:',
    options: [
      'The government guarantees the payments',

      'Expected present value of benefits equals premium paid',
      'Returns exceed inflation',
    ],
    correctIndex: 2,
    difficulty: 'easy',
    explanation: 'Actuarial fairness means EPV of Benefits = Premium Paid. On average, accounting for mortality probabilities, you get back what you put in.',

    question: '"Ex ante" fairness refers to:',
    options: [

      'Fairness in hindsight',
    ],
    correctIndex: 0,
    difficulty: 'medium',
    explanation: 'Ex ante (before the fact) evaluates fairness in expectation—before we know outcomes. Actuarial fairness is an ex ante concept.',

    difficulty: 'medium',
    explanation: 'Ex post (after the fact), there will always be "winners" and "losers"—that\'s the nature of pooling. Early deaths receive less, long livers receive more.',

      'Everyone gets the same amount',
      'There is no risk involved',
      'Investment returns are guaranteed',

    correctIndex: 0,
    difficulty: 'easy',
    explanation: 'Actuarial fairness means no one is systematically exploited, expected returns equal investment, and variations come from luck, not unfair design.',

  {
    id: 5,
    type: 'multiple-choice',
    question: 'The key insight for evaluating tontine fairness is to use:',
    options: [
      'Minimum guaranteed payouts',
      'Expected values before outcomes are known',
      'Actual payouts received',
      'Maximum possible payouts',
    ],
    correctIndex: 1,
    difficulty: 'hard',
    explanation: 'Fairness must be evaluated before we know who will live or die—using expected values that account for mortality probabilities.',

    type: 'multiple-choice',
    question: 'To calculate actuarial fairness, we need to combine:',
    options: [
      'Investment returns and inflation',

      'Risk tolerance and age',
    ],
    correctIndex: 1,
    difficulty: 'hard',
    explanation: 'Actuarial fairness requires combining survival probabilities (how likely to be alive) with discounting (time value of money).',
