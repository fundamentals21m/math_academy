1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,440
There's a motor in an abandoned factory, a motor that runs on static electricity drawn from the atmosphere.

2
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:10,679
Inexhaustible, revolutionary, impossible.

3
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:17,679
Dagnye found it early in her search, a machine that could power the world left to rust by someone who walked away.

4
00:00:17,679 --> 00:00:22,440
Now she knows who built it, and she understands why he left it behind.

5
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:27,839
The generator tells us everything about the mind that created it, and the world that destroyed him.

6
00:00:28,339 --> 00:00:35,619
Previously, the egoist, rational self-interest as virtue, not the petty grabbing of desires,

7
00:00:35,619 --> 00:00:40,979
but the systematic philosophy of self-value. John Galt showed that selfishness,

8
00:00:40,979 --> 00:00:45,140
properly understood, is not a crime, but the foundation of the good life.

9
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:53,380
Welcome back to Atlas shrugged. In our last episode, we explored rational selfishness

10
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:58,820
as the novel's core virtue. Today we return to one of the book's most powerful symbols,

11
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:06,340
the motor. The title, the generator, has a double meaning. It refers to the revolutionary

12
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:13,060
engine John Galt invented, and to Galt himself, the mind that generates the ideas and values

13
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:20,099
driving the strike. This chapter brings together the novel's themes of mind, achievement, and withdrawal.

14
00:01:20,599 --> 00:01:24,599
John Galt built a motor that could transform civilization.

15
00:01:24,599 --> 00:01:26,680
Free energy from the atmosphere.

16
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:28,040
No fuel costs.

17
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:29,560
No pollution.

18
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:32,040
Unlimited power for everyone.

19
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:34,599
He built it at the 20th century motor company,

20
00:01:34,599 --> 00:01:39,879
working in obscurity, driven by the pure joy of solving an impossible problem.

21
00:01:39,879 --> 00:01:43,159
He was young, brilliant, idealistic.

22
00:01:43,159 --> 00:01:46,359
A man who believed his achievement would be celebrated.

23
00:01:46,359 --> 00:01:50,200
Then the factories owners died, and their heirs took over.

24
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:54,840
They implemented a new policy, from each according to his ability,

25
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:57,079
to each according to his need.

26
00:01:57,079 --> 00:02:00,359
The harder you worked, the less you kept,

27
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:04,120
the more capable you were, the more you owed.

28
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:06,519
Galt saw immediately what this meant.

29
00:02:06,519 --> 00:02:11,879
His motor, his creation, his achievement, his child,

30
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:15,639
would be seized, not purchased or traded for,

31
00:02:15,639 --> 00:02:19,159
but taken, because he could create it and others couldn't.

32
00:02:19,159 --> 00:02:20,680
He owed it to them.

33
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,120
He refused.

34
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:25,639
He quit on the spot, walked away from his invention,

35
00:02:25,639 --> 00:02:27,719
and left it to rust.

36
00:02:27,719 --> 00:02:29,800
If they wanted the products of ability,

37
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:33,319
they could have them, without the ability that produced them.

38
00:02:33,819 --> 00:02:37,979
The motor represents what the world has lost by punishing achievement.

39
00:02:37,979 --> 00:02:40,379
Think of what that technology could have meant.

40
00:02:40,379 --> 00:02:44,219
Cheap energy for everyone. An end to scarcity.

41
00:02:44,219 --> 00:02:47,099
Material prosperity beyond imagination.

42
00:02:47,099 --> 00:02:49,659
All of it abandoned because the men who controlled it

43
00:02:49,659 --> 00:02:55,659
decided that creators don't deserve their creations.

44
00:02:55,659 --> 00:03:00,060
Because they taught the world that achievement is exploitation and ability

45
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:01,659
is debt.

46
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:07,740
Galt didn't destroy the motor out of spite. He left it because he refused to be a slave.

47
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:13,419
If his work belonged to others simply because they needed it, then he would stop working.

48
00:03:14,219 --> 00:03:15,819
Let them generate their own miracles.

49
00:03:16,939 --> 00:03:21,580
The motor rusting in the factory is a monument to everything collectivism destroys.

50
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:26,060
Not just the physical invention but the spirit that created it.

51
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:30,379
The joy of solving problems. The pride of achievement. The reward of success.

52
00:03:30,379 --> 00:03:39,979
Kill that spirit and the motor stop.

53
00:03:40,479 --> 00:03:46,240
The generator, Gaul's motor and Gaul himself, represents the source of all human progress.

54
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:49,520
The mind that sees a problem and imagines a solution.

55
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:52,800
The will that perseveres through failure after failure.

56
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:56,080
The integrity that refuses to produce under compulsion.

57
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:59,680
This is what the world abandoned when it declared war on achievement.

58
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:04,000
This is what the looters cannot replace no matter how many directives they issue.

59
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,639
This is what makes civilization possible,

60
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:10,560
and what makes its destruction certain once the generators withdraw.

61
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:15,280
The motor sits in the factory, proof of what could have been.

62
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,639
A technology that would have changed everything.

63
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:22,560
Left to rot because its creator was told he didn't deserve to control it.

64
00:04:23,439 --> 00:04:28,079
John Gaul walks free in the valley, having chosen his own life over service to those who despise him.

65
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:33,199
He could power the world, but only if the world acknowledges his right to exist.

66
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,800
Until then, the generator remains silent.

67
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,800
See you in the next episode.
