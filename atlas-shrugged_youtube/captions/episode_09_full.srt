1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,200
I have been thinking of nothing but you for the past week.

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:07,320
I have been thinking of the way you carry your head, of the manner of your walk, of the

3
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:09,279
sound of your voice.

4
00:00:09,279 --> 00:00:12,919
Hank Reardon has achieved everything he set out to achieve.

5
00:00:12,919 --> 00:00:17,120
His medal is vindicated, his line is running, his enemies are silenced.

6
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:20,000
Yet he cannot accept happiness without guilt.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,800
The mind-body split that conventional morality has taught him makes triumph feel like sin.

8
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:31,059
Previously, against all predictions of disaster, the John Galt Line's first run was a triumph.

9
00:00:31,059 --> 00:00:35,380
Dagnie and Reardon rode the new rails at unprecedented speed, the bridge held,

10
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:38,020
and they proved that achievement is still possible.

11
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:43,939
It was the novel's high point, and the last moment of pure triumph before everything changes.

12
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:46,740
Welcome back to Atlas Shrugged.

13
00:00:47,939 --> 00:00:52,579
In our last episode, we witnessed the triumphant first run of the John Galt Line.

14
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:57,060
Today, we explore the deepening relationship between Dagnie and Reardon,

15
00:00:57,859 --> 00:01:01,939
and Reardon's internal conflict about it.

16
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:09,379
While the John Galt Line flourishes, Reardon struggles with guilt imposed by conventional morality,

17
00:01:09,379 --> 00:01:12,659
unable to integrate his physical desires with his self-respect.

18
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:18,980
The title, The Sacred and the Profane, refers to the false dichotomy Reardon has accepted,

19
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:26,819
that the spiritual, his work, his mind, his achievements, his sacred, while the physical,

20
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:40,980
his body, his desires, his profane. This split tortures him even in the midst of joy.

21
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:45,879
In the aftermath of success, Reardon and Dagnye continue their relationship,

22
00:01:45,879 --> 00:01:48,599
but Reardon cannot accept happiness without guilt.

23
00:01:48,599 --> 00:01:53,159
He has internalized the conventional view that physical desire is base and shameful,

24
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:59,480
separate from and opposed to his spiritual values. His mind created Reardon,

25
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:06,359
Metal, and that is noble. His body desires Dagnye, and that must be base.

26
00:02:07,319 --> 00:02:12,919
He felt the desire to have her and fought it. He had held desire as something to be conquered.

27
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:19,719
He had won every battle against an animate nature, but this was a battle he lost.

28
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:26,039
And yet, why should he want to win it? Why should desire for someone he admires be something

29
00:02:26,039 --> 00:02:34,199
to conquer rather than celebrate?

30
00:02:34,699 --> 00:02:39,340
The chapter reveals how Lillian has shaped Reardin's view of physical desire.

31
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:42,379
Lillian has made him feel that his desires are degrading.

32
00:02:42,379 --> 00:02:48,780
To her, sex is something base that a wife tolerates as a duty, a necessary evil of marriage.

33
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:51,419
She performs it with cold resignation.

34
00:02:51,419 --> 00:02:54,939
Making Redden feel that his passion is an imposition.

35
00:02:54,939 --> 00:02:57,379
His desire, a flaw.

36
00:02:57,379 --> 00:03:02,139
This has left Redden unable to integrate his physical and spiritual nature.

37
00:03:02,219 --> 00:03:06,379
He believes that to desire someone physically is to degrade them,

38
00:03:06,379 --> 00:03:10,379
even when that desire springs from admiration.

39
00:03:10,379 --> 00:03:12,539
Dagnesees things differently.

40
00:03:12,539 --> 00:03:17,259
She does not separate body from mind, desire from value.

41
00:03:17,259 --> 00:03:22,219
To her, physical attraction is the expression of spiritual admiration.

42
00:03:22,219 --> 00:03:24,539
Not its opposite.

43
00:03:24,539 --> 00:03:27,099
She desires Redden because she admires him,

44
00:03:27,099 --> 00:03:30,539
and her desire is an act of celebration, not degradation.

45
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:34,280
Meanwhile, the world outside continues to deteriorate.

46
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:40,120
James Taggart, rather than celebrating the success of his own railroads line, is resentful and bitter.

47
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:44,759
The success was Dagnies, not his, achieved despite his opposition.

48
00:03:44,759 --> 00:03:47,879
He cannot enjoy prosperity, he did not earn.

49
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:50,039
The looters begin planning their next assault.

50
00:03:50,039 --> 00:03:56,080
The John Galt line's success has proven that achievement is possible, and that threatens everything they believe.

51
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:03,919
If Redden Metal works, if producers can still triumph, then the looters' philosophy of inevitable decline is wrong.

52
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:05,400
They cannot allow that.

53
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:12,840
New restrictions must be imposed, new obstacles must be created, achievement must be punished until it becomes impossible.

54
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:15,460
Let's recap what we learned today.

55
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:18,819
Reardon struggles with the mind-body split.

56
00:04:18,819 --> 00:04:24,459
The false dichotomy between sacred spiritual values and profane physical desires.

57
00:04:24,459 --> 00:04:27,699
Lillian has taught him to feel ashamed of his desires,

58
00:04:27,699 --> 00:04:31,699
to see passion as degradation rather than celebration.

59
00:04:31,699 --> 00:04:34,459
Dagnye offers a different view.

60
00:04:34,459 --> 00:04:40,019
Physical desire has the expression of spiritual values, not their opposite,

61
00:04:40,139 --> 00:04:43,860
and the looters, threatened by the John Galt Line's success,

62
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:46,620
plan their next assault on achievement.

63
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:53,060
In the next episode, Part 1 concludes with a shocking image.

64
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:58,579
Ellis Wyatt sets fire to his own oil fields and vanishes,

65
00:04:58,579 --> 00:05:01,620
leaving behind Wyatt's torch,

66
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:06,779
a symbol of the producer's rebellion against those who would seize their creations.

67
00:05:06,779 --> 00:05:08,100
See you in the next one.
