1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,720
Miss Taggart, who is John Gault?

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:06,639
We are, the crowd roars as the John Gault line opens.

3
00:00:06,639 --> 00:00:12,960
After months of predictions of disaster, attacks from the media and condemnation from the intellectual establishment,

4
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:17,440
Dagnetaggart and Hank Reardon are about to stake their lives on their own work.

5
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:21,859
Previously, the equalization of Opportunity Bill passed.

6
00:00:21,859 --> 00:00:24,500
No person may own more than one business.

7
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:29,859
Wesley Mouch, Reardon's own lobbyist, betrayed his employer to gain political power.

8
00:00:29,859 --> 00:00:31,460
The pattern is undeniable.

9
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:35,939
In this new world, success is not earned through ability, but through political connection.

10
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:37,780
Welcome back to Atlas Shrugged.

11
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:43,219
In our last episode, we saw the equalization of Opportunity Bill's strip Reardon of his or mines.

12
00:00:43,859 --> 00:00:46,179
Today is the triumphant culmination of Part 1.

13
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:53,299
The John Galt Line opens, proving that Reardon Metal is safe and that achievement is possible

14
00:00:53,299 --> 00:00:55,219
despite every attempt to stop it.

15
00:00:56,420 --> 00:01:01,619
Dagnye and Reardon will ride the first train themselves, risking their lives on their own creation.

16
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:06,659
This is what it means to be a producer, to stake everything on your own judgment,

17
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:11,700
to trust your work with your life, to answer your enemies not with words, but with achievement.

18
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:17,159
The John Gault line is complete. Eddie Willers cuts the ribbon to open the line.

19
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:21,799
When photographers ask him to stage the moment for multiple shots, he refuses.

20
00:01:21,799 --> 00:01:27,560
It's not going to be a phony. This small act of integrity captures the spirit of the enterprise.

21
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:35,560
Everything about the John Gault line is real. The rails, the bridge, the achievement.

22
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:39,799
No pretense, no public relations, no lies.

23
00:01:39,879 --> 00:01:44,760
Crowds have gathered from all over to watch. Some hope the train will crash,

24
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:49,319
vindication of their predictions. Others cheer for success.

25
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:54,280
The line has become a symbol of the battle between achievement and destruction,

26
00:01:55,079 --> 00:02:04,680
between those who create and those who tear down.

27
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:09,979
Dagnian Reardon climbed into the engine cab. They will ride the first train themselves,

28
00:02:09,979 --> 00:02:14,460
staking their lives on the safety of Reardon metal and the soundness of their work.

29
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:18,780
The train begins to move. The green blue rails run to meet them,

30
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:22,419
like two jets shot from a single point beyond the curve of the earth.

31
00:02:22,419 --> 00:02:26,740
The cross-ties melt into a smooth stream rolling down under the wheels.

32
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:31,300
Listen to Dagnese experience. She felt no wheels under the floor.

33
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:34,659
The motion was a smooth flight on a sustained impulse.

34
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:43,219
This is the joy of achievement. The integration of mind and matter, purpose and action.

35
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:50,580
Everything she is rides on those rails. The train reaches speeds never before achieved.

36
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:54,740
It crosses the revolutionary Reardon metal bridge without incident.

37
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:58,099
The bridge holds. The rails hold. The achievement is real.

38
00:02:58,599 --> 00:03:01,000
The run is a complete success.

39
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,840
Reardon medal has been vindicated, not by arguments or press releases,

40
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,599
but by reality itself.

41
00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:09,960
The train that everyone said would crash has arrived safely.

42
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:13,319
The bridge that everyone said would collapse has held.

43
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:18,199
This is how truth is established, not by authority, not by committee vote,

44
00:03:18,199 --> 00:03:22,280
not by public opinion, but by the facts of reality.

45
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:24,759
Reardon medal is safe because it is safe,

46
00:03:24,759 --> 00:03:29,479
regardless of what the state science institute implies or what the media predicts.

47
00:03:29,479 --> 00:03:33,960
When someone asks Dagnie, who is John Galt, she has her answer.

48
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:37,639
We are. The producers, the creators.

49
00:03:37,639 --> 00:03:40,840
The people who refuse to accept that achievement is impossible.

50
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:44,520
They have answered the question not with words, but with deeds,

51
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:48,599
with rails of reardon medals stretching across Colorado.

52
00:03:49,099 --> 00:03:51,599
Let's recap what we learned today.

53
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:56,860
The John Galt line opens triumphantly, proving that Reardon Metal is safe and that achievement

54
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:58,560
is still possible.

55
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:03,159
Dagnian Reardon stake their lives on their own work, writing in the engine cab of the first

56
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:04,659
train.

57
00:04:04,659 --> 00:04:08,900
Truth is established by reality, not authority.

58
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:13,460
The train runs, the bridge holds, the metal is vindicated.

59
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:18,339
And the question, who is John Galt receives its first answer.

60
00:04:18,339 --> 00:04:23,899
The producers are John Galt, those who create, despite every obstacle.

61
00:04:23,899 --> 00:04:29,300
In the next episode we'll explore the deepening relationship between Dagnian Reardon and

62
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:33,500
Reardon's internal conflict about the mind-body split he has accepted.

63
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:37,980
Even in triumph, he struggles with guilt imposed by conventional morality.

64
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:38,899
See you in the next one.
