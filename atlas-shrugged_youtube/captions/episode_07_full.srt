1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The man who speaks to you of sacrifice speaks of slaves and masters and intends to be the master.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
The equalization of opportunity bill has passed.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Hank Reardon must sell his or mines property he built through decades of work,

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
to men who could never dig a single chunk of ore from the earth.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
The looters call this fairness.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Rand calls it exploitation.

7
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:27,980
Previously, the State Science Institute published a report attacking Reardon medal,

8
00:00:28,539 --> 00:00:32,539
not because it's dangerous, but because Reardon succeeded without their permission.

9
00:00:33,179 --> 00:00:38,460
Even Dr. Robert Stadler, a brilliant physicist who knows the truth, signed off on the false report.

10
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:44,460
Science has been corrupted by politics. Welcome back to Atlas Shrugged.

11
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:49,820
In our last episode, we saw how the intellectual establishment attacks producers through

12
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:55,820
institutions like the State Science Institute. Today, the assault becomes direct.

13
00:00:56,539 --> 00:01:00,780
The equalization of opportunity bill passes, forcing Reardon to sell his or mines.

14
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:05,500
We'll see who truly exploits whom in a society corrupted by political pull,

15
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:10,540
and watches Dagnian Reardon race to complete the John Gault line before their enemies can stop them.

16
00:01:11,099 --> 00:01:17,019
The title, The Exploitors and the Exploited, inverts the Marxist narrative that capitalist exploit workers.

17
00:01:17,739 --> 00:01:23,980
Rand argues the opposite. It is the looters who exploit the producers, using government force to seize

18
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:27,980
what they cannot earn.

19
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:31,359
the equalization of opportunity bill passes.

20
00:01:31,359 --> 00:01:37,280
This legislation forces any business owner who operates in multiple industries to divest from all but one.

21
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:41,519
Reardon, who owns steel mills and or mines, must sell his mines.

22
00:01:41,519 --> 00:01:49,040
The bill is presented as helping the little guy, giving smaller competitors a chance against industrial giants.

23
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,519
But look at what it actually does.

24
00:01:51,519 --> 00:01:56,079
It strips a productive man of property he built through decades of work,

25
00:01:56,079 --> 00:02:00,959
transferring it to competitors who never demonstrated the ability to create it themselves.

26
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,120
The men who voted for this bill, who knows by what mines,

27
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:10,159
who knows whose will place them in power, what motive move them, what was their knowledge,

28
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:15,039
which one of them, unated, could bring a single chunk of ore out of the earth.

29
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,159
This is the inversion of exploitation.

30
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,479
The productive are forced to surrender their creations to the unproductive.

31
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,120
Achievement is punished.

32
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,120
In competence is rewarded.

33
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:30,199
Wesley Much reveals his true colors.

34
00:02:30,199 --> 00:02:33,199
Rardon had employed much as his Washington lobbyist,

35
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:35,599
paid him to represent his interests.

36
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:38,699
But Much has been working with the conspirators all along.

37
00:02:38,699 --> 00:02:40,500
His reward for betrayal,

38
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:46,199
appointment as assistant coordinator of the Bureau of Economic Planning and National Resources.

39
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:48,539
Much traded his integrity for power,

40
00:02:48,539 --> 00:02:52,280
and in the new system, that's a profitable trade.

41
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:54,080
The lesson is clear.

42
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,740
You cannot work within a corrupt system.

43
00:02:56,900 --> 00:03:01,740
Hiring lobbyists to deal with government is futile when the government rewards those who serve the looters,

44
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:03,659
not those who create value.

45
00:03:03,659 --> 00:03:07,460
Rardon realizes too late that he was funding his own destruction.

46
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:10,060
Every dollar he paid Much was used against him.

47
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,960
Meanwhile, Dagnian Reardon worked frantically to complete the John Gaunt line.

48
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:18,000
The railroad through Colorado built with Reardon Metal.

49
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,240
They face opposition from every direction.

50
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,840
The media predicts disaster.

51
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,639
The State Science Institute questions the metal safety.

52
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:29,360
James Taggart undermines his own sister.

53
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:36,080
But they press forward, determined to prove that achievement is possible despite every attempt to stop it.

54
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:40,000
The John Gaunt line becomes more than a railroad.

55
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,120
It becomes a symbol.

56
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:45,919
A test of whether productive people can still accomplish great things in a world designed to prevent them.

57
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:49,280
Dagnian names it after the question that haunts the world.

58
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,280
Who is John Gaunt?

59
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:52,639
Her answer?

60
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,080
We are.

61
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:55,680
The producers.

62
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:57,120
The creators.

63
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:06,319
The people who refuse to give up.

64
00:04:06,819 --> 00:04:09,219
Let's recap what we learned today.

65
00:04:09,219 --> 00:04:13,419
The equalization of opportunity bill forces Reardon to sell his or mines,

66
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:16,579
rewarding the incompetent at the expense of the productive.

67
00:04:16,579 --> 00:04:20,819
Wesley Moch's betrayal shows that working within the system is futile.

68
00:04:20,819 --> 00:04:23,660
The system rewards those who serve the looters.

69
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:26,019
The true exploiters are not the industrialists,

70
00:04:26,019 --> 00:04:29,819
but the looters who use government force to seize what they cannot create.

71
00:04:29,819 --> 00:04:32,620
And Dagnian Reardon prepared to answer the question,

72
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:35,620
who is John Gault with their own achievement?

73
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:37,620
The John Gault line.

74
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:42,220
In the next episode, we'll witness the triumphant first run of the John Gault line.

75
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:45,220
Dagnian Reardon will stake their lives on their own work.

76
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:50,819
Writing in the engine cab is the train crosses the revolutionary Reardon metal bridge.

77
00:04:50,819 --> 00:04:51,819
See you in the next one.
