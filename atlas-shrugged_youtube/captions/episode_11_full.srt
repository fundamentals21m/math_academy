1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,399
Welcome to Part 2, either or.

2
00:00:03,399 --> 00:00:06,040
The world has changed since Wyatt's torch.

3
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:08,480
The producers are disappearing faster now.

4
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:11,679
The economy spirals downward and somewhere.

5
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:16,039
Someone is recruiting the best minds for a purpose no one yet understands.

6
00:00:16,039 --> 00:00:19,800
Today we meet a scientist who creates revolutionary technology

7
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:22,760
and face the choice that confronts everyone in this world.

8
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:25,000
Either produce or loot.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,320
Either think or evade.

10
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:28,519
There is no middle ground.

11
00:00:29,019 --> 00:00:34,140
Previously, Wyatt's torch. Rather than surrender his oilfields to the looters,

12
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:39,420
Ellis Wyatt set fire to everything he built and vanished. He left behind a pillar of flame

13
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:45,259
that will burn for years, and a note. I am leaving it as I found it. Take over. It's yours.

14
00:00:46,219 --> 00:00:48,140
Part 1 has ended in fire.

15
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:56,380
Welcome to Part 2. Either or. In Part 1, we watched the world decline as capable people vanished.

16
00:00:57,020 --> 00:01:04,780
We saw the John Galt line's triumph and Wyatt's fiery departure. Part 2. Either or intensifies the

17
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:11,260
conflict. The title comes from the law of excluded middle. A thing is either A or not A.

18
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:18,299
In this section, characters must choose sides. Either you stand with the producers or with the

19
00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:25,900
looters. Either you use your mind or you surrender it. The opening chapter introduces revolutionary

20
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:35,900
technology and asks, who truly belongs on earth, those who create, or those who consume.

21
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:39,719
We meet a brilliant scientist whose work could transform the world.

22
00:01:39,719 --> 00:01:43,439
Technology that seems almost impossible, yet functions.

23
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:47,599
This man represents what human achievement can accomplish when the mind is free.

24
00:01:47,599 --> 00:01:52,239
His inventions work not by magic, but by the application of reason to reality.

25
00:01:52,239 --> 00:01:55,400
He has discovered principles that others said were impossible.

26
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:58,239
Built machines that others said could not exist.

27
00:01:58,239 --> 00:02:02,480
But in a world that punishes achievement, what happens to such a man?

28
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:06,319
Where does genius go when genius itself becomes a crime?

29
00:02:06,819 --> 00:02:10,979
The chapter presents the fundamental choice facing everyone in this world.

30
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:13,620
The looters offer safety through submission.

31
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:18,500
Surrender your judgment, follow the collective, ask permission for every action,

32
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:22,979
and you can survive. Perhaps. The producers offer something else.

33
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:31,300
Freedom and its consequences. Use your mind, create value, live by your own judgment,

34
00:02:31,939 --> 00:02:35,139
and face the full force of a system designed to destroy you.

35
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:41,060
There is no compromise. You cannot have think. You cannot partially produce.

36
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:47,060
Either you are a creator or a parasite. Either you move the world or you cling to it.

37
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:49,539
This is the meaning of either or.

38
00:02:50,039 --> 00:02:54,120
Part 2 begins with a question, who belongs on Earth?

39
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:57,879
The scientist who creates revolutionary technology belongs here.

40
00:02:57,879 --> 00:03:01,120
His mind shaped the world to serve human purposes.

41
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:05,180
The looters who seize his work without understanding it are aliens on their own planet,

42
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:09,360
unable to survive, without those they despise.

43
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:14,360
As the novel progresses, we'll see more characters face the fundamental choice.

44
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:19,919
We'll watch the aristocracy of pull replace the aristocracy of ability.

45
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:24,520
We'll see guilt used as a weapon and victims' grant sanction to their destroyers.

46
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:27,120
The producers are learning a new response.

47
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,479
Withdrawal.

48
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:32,400
If society will not let them create, they will stop creating.

49
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,199
And let the looters discover what that means.

50
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:36,680
See you in the next episode.
