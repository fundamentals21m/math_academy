1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,919
We can't help it if the process of civilization is a process of destroying competition.

2
00:00:04,919 --> 00:00:08,599
The strong always win against the weak, and it isn't fair.

3
00:00:08,599 --> 00:00:13,400
These words are spoken by James Taggart, not in public, but in a dingy bar surrounded

4
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:15,439
by fellow conspirators.

5
00:00:15,439 --> 00:00:19,760
Behind closed doors, the looters reveal their true philosophy.

6
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:22,760
Use government force to destroy anyone better than yourself.

7
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:27,739
Previously, Hank Reardon watched the first poor of his revolutionary medal.

8
00:00:27,739 --> 00:00:33,899
Ten years of work made real. But instead of celebration, his family met his triumph with contempt.

9
00:00:34,299 --> 00:00:37,659
His wife called it vulgar. His brother called it showing off.

10
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:41,500
Achievement, it seems, is something to feel guilty about.

11
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:44,380
Welcome back to Atlas Shrugged.

12
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:51,020
In our last episode, we met Hank Reardon and witnessed the first poor of his revolutionary medal.

13
00:00:51,659 --> 00:00:57,259
Today, we expose the conspiracy of the looters. We'll see how James Taggart,

14
00:00:57,259 --> 00:01:02,060
Orrin Boyle and other political operators plot to use government regulation to destroy

15
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:08,780
their more capable competitors. The title, the top and the bottom contrasts those at the top of

16
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:16,140
society, the productive achievers, with those at the bottom, the schemers who use political pull rather

17
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:26,140
than ability to advance.

18
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:32,640
The chapter opens with James Taggart meeting secretly with Oran Boyle of Associated Steel, Wesley Moch,

19
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,640
Reardon's own Washington lobbyist, and Paul Larkin.

20
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:41,120
They gather in a dingy bar, deliberately avoiding the respectable establishments where honest

21
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:43,120
businessmen might see them THEM.

22
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:48,159
The conversation reveals their plan, use government regulation to destroy Hank Reardon and

23
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:51,040
Dan Conway's Phoenix Durango Railroad.

24
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:54,640
They speak in euphemisms about fairness and the public good.

25
00:01:54,640 --> 00:02:00,000
But their actual goal is to eliminate competition they cannot match through honest means.

26
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,200
Notice how they never speak directly about their intentions.

27
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:08,000
They cloak their plunder in language about equality, social responsibility, and protecting

28
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,280
the weak.

29
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:13,319
But the weak they claim to protect are themselves, men who cannot compete through productive

30
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:13,719
merit.

31
00:02:14,219 --> 00:02:20,719
The chapter introduces the anti-doggy dog rule, a regulation being pushed through the national alliance of railroads.

32
00:02:20,719 --> 00:02:29,719
This rule would force Dan Conway's Phoenix Durango Railroad to cease operations in Colorado, eliminating Taggart Transcontinentals' main competitor in the region.

33
00:02:29,719 --> 00:02:35,719
The rule is presented as protecting the public interest and preventing destructive competition.

34
00:02:36,219 --> 00:02:45,219
In reality, it's designed to destroy a more efficient competitor that has been winning Colorado's freight business through better service.

35
00:02:45,219 --> 00:02:52,219
This illustrates how looters use government force to accomplish what they cannot achieve through productive merit.

36
00:02:52,219 --> 00:02:57,219
Unable to compete honestly, they turn to political manipulation.

37
00:02:57,719 --> 00:02:59,879
Let's examine the conspirators.

38
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:03,560
James Taggart, president of Taggart Transcontinental,

39
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:06,919
who relies on political connections rather than competence.

40
00:03:06,919 --> 00:03:09,639
He resents his sister Dagnese abilities.

41
00:03:09,639 --> 00:03:12,759
Orrin Boyle, owner of Associated Steel,

42
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:15,879
an inefficient company that cannot compete with the Reardon's Steel.

43
00:03:16,599 --> 00:03:21,960
He wants government intervention to handicap his more capable competitor,

44
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:22,840
Wesley Moch.

45
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:27,400
Reardon's Washington lobbyist, secretly working against his employer.

46
00:03:28,039 --> 00:03:31,159
He serves as a double agent, feeding information to the conspirators.

47
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:37,159
Paul Larkin, a friend of Reardon who pretends loyalty while plotting against him.

48
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,680
He represents the false friend who profits from betrayal.

49
00:03:41,479 --> 00:03:43,479
Each conspirator shares a common trait.

50
00:03:44,039 --> 00:03:48,520
They cannot create value themselves, so they must seize it from those who can.

51
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:53,099
When Dagnie learns about the plot against Phoenix Durango, she is horrified.

52
00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:57,659
Not because Conway is a friend, but because she recognizes the injustice of destroying a better

53
00:03:57,659 --> 00:04:02,539
competitor through political means rather than market competition. Dagnie understands that the

54
00:04:02,539 --> 00:04:07,659
anti-dog eat dog rule, while benefiting Taggart transcontinental in the short term,

55
00:04:08,219 --> 00:04:13,099
represents a fundamental corruption of the principles that make business and civilization possible.

56
00:04:13,659 --> 00:04:18,220
This is a key insight. Dagnie opposes looting even when it would benefit her.

57
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:23,980
She understands that a system based on force rather than merit will ultimately destroy everyone,

58
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:26,779
including those who benefit from it temporarily.

59
00:04:27,279 --> 00:04:29,360
Let's recap what we learned today.

60
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,680
The looters' conspiracy is revealed.

61
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:37,120
Taggart, Boyle, and others plan to use government regulation to destroy their competitors.

62
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:42,879
The anti-dog eat dog rule will force the efficient Phoenix Durango Railroad out of Colorado,

63
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:45,600
rewarding incompetence and punishing success.

64
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:51,120
Wesley Mouch is betraying his employer, Reardon, working secretly with the conspirators.

65
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:56,560
The rhetoric of looting uses noble sounding language like fairness and public good

66
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,680
to disguise plunder.

67
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:03,680
And pull replaces merit as the means of success in a society corrupted by political manipulation.

68
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:08,959
In the next episode, we'll meet the prime movers of industry and learn about Francisco

69
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:14,079
D'anconea's brilliant youth. Deepening the mystery of why he seems to have abandoned his genius.

70
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:15,279
See you in the next one.
