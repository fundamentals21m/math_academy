1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,599
In every society, there is an aristocracy, a ruling class that holds power.

2
00:00:05,599 --> 00:00:09,119
The question is, what determines membership?

3
00:00:09,119 --> 00:00:14,160
In a free society, the aristocracy consists of those who produce the most value.

4
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,160
The best rise through merit.

5
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:22,079
In a society of looters, the aristocracy consists of those with the most political connections.

6
00:00:22,079 --> 00:00:25,280
The best at manipulation rise through pull.

7
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:32,880
This chapter shows the new American aristocracy, and it has nothing to do with ability.

8
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:38,500
Welcome to Part 2. The world has changed since why it's torch.

9
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:43,299
Producers are vanishing faster now. The economy spirals downward.

10
00:00:43,299 --> 00:00:48,340
And somewhere, someone is recruiting the best minds for a purpose no one yet understands.

11
00:00:49,619 --> 00:00:51,299
Welcome back to Atlas Shrugged.

12
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:57,539
In our last episode, we began Part 2 with the fundamental choice facing everyone.

13
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:01,299
Produce or loot, think or evade.

14
00:01:02,179 --> 00:01:06,500
Today we examine how political connections have replaced merit as the path to success.

15
00:01:07,459 --> 00:01:14,739
The title, the aristocracy of pull, describes the new ruling class, people who achieve position

16
00:01:14,739 --> 00:01:19,939
not through ability, but through knowing the right people, making the right donations,

17
00:01:20,579 --> 00:01:26,099
and saying the right things. In this world, it's not what you can do that matters.

18
00:01:26,099 --> 00:01:34,980
It's who you know.

19
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:39,079
Merit means earning your position through demonstrated ability.

20
00:01:39,079 --> 00:01:42,280
You rise because you can do the job better than others.

21
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:45,719
The best surgeon gets patience because she saves lives.

22
00:01:45,719 --> 00:01:49,239
The best engineer gets contracts because his bridges stand.

23
00:01:49,239 --> 00:01:52,680
Pull means getting your position through political connection.

24
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:56,200
You rise because you know someone or because you've contributed to the right

25
00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:00,200
campaign or because you've said the right things to the right people.

26
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:03,640
The connected surgeon gets patience regardless of skill.

27
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:10,599
The connected engineer gets contracts regardless of competence.

28
00:02:10,599 --> 00:02:15,080
When pull replaces Merit, the consequences are predictable.

29
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:18,120
Bridges collapse. Patients die.

30
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:22,840
Quality disappears. But the aristocracy of pull doesn't care.

31
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:27,000
They're insulated from consequences by their connections.

32
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:31,060
The chapter shows us this new aristocracy in action.

33
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:35,259
Wesley Mouch has risen to power, not through any productive achievement,

34
00:02:35,259 --> 00:02:38,819
but through betraying his employer and serving the looters.

35
00:02:38,819 --> 00:02:42,139
James Taggart holds his position not because he can run a railroad,

36
00:02:42,139 --> 00:02:46,020
but because he has political allies.

37
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:49,539
Orin Boyle competes not by making better steel,

38
00:02:49,539 --> 00:02:52,939
but by getting laws passed against his competitors.

39
00:02:52,939 --> 00:02:56,300
These are the new lords of America.

40
00:02:56,379 --> 00:02:58,979
Their castles are government offices.

41
00:02:58,979 --> 00:03:02,620
Their armies are bureaucrats with regulatory power.

42
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:05,979
Their weapons are laws and directives that can destroy anyone

43
00:03:05,979 --> 00:03:07,740
who threatens their position.

44
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:11,699
And like all aristocracies based on something other than merit,

45
00:03:11,699 --> 00:03:14,500
this one is fundamentally unstable.

46
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:17,099
It can seize wealth, but it cannot create it.

47
00:03:17,099 --> 00:03:20,219
It can destroy producers, but it cannot replace them.

48
00:03:20,719 --> 00:03:24,639
The aristocracy of pull has replaced the aristocracy of ability.

49
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:27,840
In the old America, you rose by being good at something.

50
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,960
In the new America, you rise by knowing someone.

51
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,960
The consequences are everywhere.

52
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:35,840
Failing businesses run by connected incompetence.

53
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,199
Crumbling infrastructure, maintained by political appointees.

54
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:42,240
Innovations banned because they threaten the wrong people.

55
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:44,159
The producers see what's happening.

56
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:46,639
Some submit and try to play the game.

57
00:03:46,639 --> 00:03:48,800
Some fight and lose.

58
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:52,960
And some, a growing number, simply disappear.

59
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:56,400
They refuse to serve an aristocracy that punishes their virtues

60
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,960
and rewards their enemy's vices.

61
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:01,599
The question, who is John Galt?

62
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:03,439
Grows more urgent.

63
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:08,639
Someone is offering the producers an alternative to the aristocracy of pull.

64
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:11,439
See you in the next episode.
