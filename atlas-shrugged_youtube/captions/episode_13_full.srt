1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,279
Blackmail works by threatening to reveal something shameful.

2
00:00:03,279 --> 00:00:05,280
The victim pays to keep a secret hidden.

3
00:00:05,919 --> 00:00:08,320
But what if the shameful thing isn't shameful at all?

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:12,560
What if the victim is being made to feel guilty for something that is actually good?

5
00:00:13,119 --> 00:00:17,600
This is white blackmail. The use of unearned guilt as a weapon against the productive.

6
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:23,359
And it may be the looter's most powerful tool.

7
00:00:23,859 --> 00:00:30,339
Previously, the aristocracy of pull has replaced the aristocracy of ability. Wesley Mouch holds power,

8
00:00:30,339 --> 00:00:35,859
not through productive achievement, but through betrayal. James Taggart succeeds, not by running a

9
00:00:35,859 --> 00:00:42,820
railroad but by having political allies. These are the new lords of America. Their weapon is regulation.

10
00:00:43,859 --> 00:00:50,100
Welcome back to Atlas Shrugged. In our last episode, we examined the aristocracy of pull that has

11
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:58,100
replaced merit as the path to success. Today, we explore a more insidious weapon, guilt. The title

12
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:05,379
White Black Male refers to the manipulation of decent people through their own virtues. The

13
00:01:05,379 --> 00:01:10,739
looters cannot defeat the producers through ability, so they attack through morality, making the

14
00:01:10,739 --> 00:01:16,659
producers feel guilty for their own excellence. This chapter shows how guilt becomes a chain stronger

15
00:01:16,659 --> 00:01:26,659
than any law.

16
00:01:27,159 --> 00:01:30,120
The producers have been taught to feel guilty for their virtues.

17
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:31,640
Are you successful?

18
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:32,920
You should feel guilty.

19
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:34,200
Others are not.

20
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,640
Are you intelligent?

21
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:36,920
You should feel guilty.

22
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:38,280
Others are not.

23
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,719
Are you productive?

24
00:01:39,719 --> 00:01:41,239
You should feel guilty.

25
00:01:41,239 --> 00:01:42,760
Others are not.

26
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:45,319
This guilt has no basis in wrongdoing.

27
00:01:45,319 --> 00:01:47,480
The producer has harmed no one.

28
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:52,120
But he has been taught that his success itself is an offense against those who have not succeeded.

29
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:55,400
That his ability is an insult to those who lack it.

30
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:59,319
White blackmail exploits this manufactured guilt.

31
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:02,519
The looters say, you have more than others.

32
00:02:02,519 --> 00:02:04,200
You should share.

33
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:08,199
The producer feeling guilty for having more shares.

34
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:12,599
The looters say, you are able while others are not.

35
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:15,000
You should sacrifice.

36
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,520
The producer feeling guilty for his ability.

37
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:20,120
Sacrifices.

38
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,800
No threat is made.

39
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,800
No force is used.

40
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:27,719
The victim destroys himself through his own misplaced virtue.

41
00:02:28,219 --> 00:02:31,020
Here's how white blackmail works in practice.

42
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:35,020
First, convince the producer that his success is somehow illegitimate,

43
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:38,860
that he owes his achievements to society, to luck, to privilege,

44
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:40,819
to anything except his own effort.

45
00:02:40,819 --> 00:02:44,659
Second, convince him that his success harms others,

46
00:02:44,659 --> 00:02:49,259
that wealth is a zero-sum game,

47
00:02:49,259 --> 00:02:52,180
that his gain is someone else's loss,

48
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:55,819
that his excellence makes others feel inferior.

49
00:02:56,020 --> 00:03:01,020
Third, demand that he atone for this imaginary sin through sacrifice,

50
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:05,900
giving up his wealth, his time, his judgment, his self-respect.

51
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:10,819
The producer, accepting the premise that his virtues or vices complies,

52
00:03:10,819 --> 00:03:12,780
he doesn't see that he's being robbed,

53
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:14,740
he thinks he's making amends.

54
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:16,979
This is more effective than force.

55
00:03:16,979 --> 00:03:19,300
Force creates resistance.

56
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:20,939
Guilt creates surrender.

57
00:03:21,439 --> 00:03:26,740
White blackmail, the use of unearned guilt as a weapon, may be the looter's most powerful tool.

58
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:30,800
They cannot match the producers in ability, so they attack through morality.

59
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:36,639
They make excellence feel like sin, success feel like crime, achievement feel like exploitation.

60
00:03:36,639 --> 00:03:44,039
The producers, accepting these false premises, bind themselves with chains no law could impose.

61
00:03:44,039 --> 00:03:48,680
They sacrifice voluntarily what the looters could never take by force.

62
00:03:48,979 --> 00:03:52,080
But some producers are beginning to question the guilt.

63
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:55,680
They're asking, why should I feel bad for being good?

64
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,280
Why should I apologize for my achievements?

65
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:01,580
Why should I sacrifice to those who contribute nothing?

66
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:05,879
When enough producers ask these questions and reject the answers they've been given,

67
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:09,280
the system of white blackmail will collapse.

68
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,780
See you in the next episode.
