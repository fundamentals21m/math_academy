1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,759
egoist, selfish, self-interested. These words are meant as insults. To be called selfish is to be

2
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:13,759
accused of a moral crime, of caring more about yourself than about others. But what if selfishness

3
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:20,000
isn't a crime? What if it's a virtue? What if caring about yourself is not just permitted,

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,480
but required for a good life? This chapter explores the concept at the heart of RAND's philosophy,

5
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:35,600
rational self-interest.

6
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:42,500
Previously, this is John Galt speaking. In a broadcast that interrupted every station in the country,

7
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:46,899
John Galt explained why the producers went on strike and what they demand for their return.

8
00:00:47,539 --> 00:00:52,659
The morality of sacrifice is wrong. The strike will continue until the mind is respected.

9
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:56,179
Welcome back to Atlas Shrugged.

10
00:00:57,700 --> 00:01:02,500
In our last episode, we heard John Galt's radio address laying out his philosophy.

11
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:09,060
Today, we go deeper into one of its most controversial elements, egoism. The title,

12
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:16,340
the egoist refers to the moral stance that your own life is your highest value,

13
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:22,819
and your own happiness is your moral purpose. This isn't the egoism of common understanding,

14
00:01:23,379 --> 00:01:29,459
the petty grabbing of immediate desires. This is something more profound, a systematic philosophy of

15
00:01:29,459 --> 00:01:31,060
self-value.

16
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:34,680
Let's be clear about what Rand means by selfishness.

17
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:37,799
She doesn't mean grabbing whatever you want without thought.

18
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:41,319
That's not self-interest. That's self-destruction.

19
00:01:41,319 --> 00:01:44,840
The addict who ruins his health for pleasure isn't being selfish.

20
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:48,599
He's being stupid. Real selfishness is rational.

21
00:01:48,599 --> 00:01:52,359
It means identifying what actually serves your life, long-term,

22
00:01:52,359 --> 00:01:56,760
comprehensively, realistically, and pursuing it with discipline and integrity.

23
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:01,319
The rational egoist doesn't steal because theft undermines the system

24
00:02:01,319 --> 00:02:03,400
of property rights that protects him.

25
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:08,439
He doesn't lie because honesty is essential to the clear thinking his survival requires.

26
00:02:08,439 --> 00:02:13,159
He doesn't exploit others because exploitation creates enemies and destroys the trust

27
00:02:13,159 --> 00:02:19,240
that makes trade possible. The rational egoist is paradoxically the most reliable person you could meet.

28
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:23,319
His self-interest is aligned with honesty, productivity, and respect for others' rights.

29
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:26,439
He's selfish, and that makes him trustworthy.

30
00:02:26,939 --> 00:02:29,500
The alternative to selfishness is altruism.

31
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:32,379
The doctrine that your moral duty is to serve others.

32
00:02:32,379 --> 00:02:37,500
But altruism, taken seriously, is impossible to practice and destructive to attempt.

33
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:41,500
If others' needs are your moral obligation, there's no end to obligation.

34
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,900
There's always someone needier.

35
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:46,539
There's always more you could sacrifice.

36
00:02:46,539 --> 00:02:51,419
The altruist whose consistent becomes a martyr, giving until nothing remains.

37
00:02:51,419 --> 00:02:55,979
And notice what altruism implies about the recipients of sacrifice.

38
00:02:55,979 --> 00:03:01,099
If someone else's sacrifice is your rightful due, then you're a parasite.

39
00:03:01,099 --> 00:03:04,060
Someone who lives off the destruction of others.

40
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:06,219
Altruism degrades everyone.

41
00:03:06,219 --> 00:03:08,139
The givers become servants.

42
00:03:08,139 --> 00:03:10,379
The receivers become beggars.

43
00:03:10,379 --> 00:03:12,939
The egoist escapes this trap.

44
00:03:12,939 --> 00:03:16,379
He doesn't demand other sacrifice and he doesn't offer his own.

45
00:03:16,379 --> 00:03:22,379
He trades, giving value for value, benefiting himself while benefiting others.

46
00:03:22,379 --> 00:03:24,219
That's not exploitation.

47
00:03:24,219 --> 00:03:25,419
That's civilization.

48
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:30,879
The egoist presents selfishness as a virtue, perhaps the fundamental virtue.

49
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:35,280
To be selfish in rand sense is to take yourself seriously.

50
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:39,919
To treat your life as something worth living, your happiness as something worth pursuing,

51
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:42,879
your values as something worth achieving.

52
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:48,319
The alternative is to live as a servant, always subordinating your needs to others' demands,

53
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:54,319
always apologizing for your existence, always sacrificing your joy on the altar of duty.

54
00:03:54,319 --> 00:04:02,879
The egoist refuses. He says, my life is mine. My happiness matters. My achievements are not crimes.

55
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:09,439
This isn't cruelty. It's integrity. It's the recognition that you cannot give what you don't have.

56
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:16,079
Cannot help others by destroying yourself. Cannot serve life. By embracing. Death.

57
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:22,879
John Galt is the novel's supreme egoist. He has claimed his life as his own and refuses to

58
00:04:22,879 --> 00:04:28,240
surrender it to anyone's demands. He is selfish, completely, unapologetically,

59
00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:36,720
proudly, selfish, and he's the hero. See you in the next episode.
