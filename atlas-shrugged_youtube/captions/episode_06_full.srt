1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
The purpose of philosophy is not to help men find the meaning of life,

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,599
but to prove to them that there isn't any.

3
00:00:06,599 --> 00:00:10,699
These are the words of Dr. Simon Pritchett, a professor of philosophy,

4
00:00:10,699 --> 00:00:15,199
and they capture the spirit of the intellectuals who claim to be above mere commerce,

5
00:00:15,199 --> 00:00:19,199
while living off the products of the very industries they despise.

6
00:00:19,699 --> 00:00:24,420
Previously, at the Reardon Party, Francisco dropped his mask and delivered the money speech.

7
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:30,660
So, you think that money is the root of all evil? Have you ever asked what is the root of money?

8
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:37,140
He argued that money is a tool of virtue, not evil, that it represents trade, not exploitation.

9
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:41,859
The intellectuals were stunned. Riardon was intrigued.

10
00:00:42,579 --> 00:00:48,420
Welcome back to Atlas Shrugged. In our last episode, we witnessed Francisco's money speech,

11
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:52,020
a philosophical defense of wealth and free exchange.

12
00:00:52,899 --> 00:00:58,420
Today, we explore the conflict between those who value commerce and production,

13
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:02,579
and those who claim to represent higher non-commercial values.

14
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:08,900
We'll meet Dr. Robert Stadler, a brilliant physicist who has sacrificed his integrity for

15
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:13,540
political survival and witness the state science institute's attack on Reardon Metal.

16
00:01:14,099 --> 00:01:18,739
The title, the non-commercial refers to those who claim to be above mere commerce,

17
00:01:19,299 --> 00:01:23,299
intellectuals, scientists, and artists who profess contempt for business while

18
00:01:23,299 --> 00:01:31,299
depending on its products for their existence.

19
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:35,640
The chapter opens with the State Science Institute releasing a statement attacking

20
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,799
Reardon Medal as unsafe.

21
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:41,319
The statement contains no actual evidence against the Medal,

22
00:01:41,319 --> 00:01:46,200
no data, no scientific argument, no concrete objection,

23
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:49,159
just vague insinuations and appeals to authority,

24
00:01:49,159 --> 00:01:55,159
designed to create doubt in the public mind and threaten the Rio Norte line project.

25
00:01:55,159 --> 00:01:58,519
This is how the non-commercial world operates,

26
00:01:58,519 --> 00:02:00,920
not through evidence and reason,

27
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,120
but through authority and innuendo.

28
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:06,920
The Institute cannot prove Reardon Medal is dangerous,

29
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:09,319
so it simply implies that it might be,

30
00:02:09,319 --> 00:02:11,319
and let's fear do the rest.

31
00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:17,819
Dagnie goes to confront Dr. Robert Stadler, the brilliant physicist who heads the State Science Institute.

32
00:02:17,819 --> 00:02:22,539
She hopes that this man, once considered one of the greatest scientific minds of the age,

33
00:02:22,539 --> 00:02:27,340
will speak the truth about Reardon Metal. What she discovers is devastating.

34
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:35,819
Stadler admits privately that Reardon Metal is a remarkable thing, but he refuses to say so publicly.

35
00:02:36,539 --> 00:02:40,139
Stadler represents the tragedy of genius without integrity.

36
00:02:40,939 --> 00:02:47,659
Once one of the greatest physicists in the world, he has allowed himself to become

37
00:02:48,539 --> 00:02:55,819
dependent on government funding and political favor. He has traded his independence for security,

38
00:02:56,460 --> 00:03:02,539
and now he must serve political masters rather than truth. Here's the key insight.

39
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:08,860
Stadler considers practical matters beneath him. He thinks he can pursue pure science while

40
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:13,580
ignoring the political uses to which it is put. But by accepting government money,

41
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:19,020
he has made himself an instrument of the looters. His contempt for the practical has destroyed his

42
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:26,539
ability to be impractical.

43
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:34,039
The chapter explores a deeper philosophical conflict, the contempt that intellectuals have for commerce and production.

44
00:03:34,039 --> 00:03:42,039
Scientists like Stadler consider business vulgar. They claim to pursue truth for its own sake, untainted by material concerns.

45
00:03:42,039 --> 00:03:49,039
Artists like Balfe Ubank believe the commercial success is proof of artistic failure.

46
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:59,039
The cultural establishment agrees money is dirty, profit is exploitation, and anyone who creates wealth is morally suspect.

47
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:09,039
But here's what they don't acknowledge. Every scientist, every artist, every intellectual depends on the products of commerce for their existence.

48
00:04:09,039 --> 00:04:17,040
The food they eat, the buildings they work in, the tools they use. All created by the businessmen they despise.

49
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:27,040
The non-commercial class is parasitic on the commercial. They cannot exist without producers, yet they claim moral superiority over those who feed them.

50
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:29,779
Let's recap what we learned today.

51
00:04:29,779 --> 00:04:31,500
The State Science Institute attacks

52
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:34,699
Reardon Medal with vague insinuations rather than evidence,

53
00:04:34,699 --> 00:04:37,100
revealing how the non-commercial world operates

54
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:39,420
through authority rather than reason.

55
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:42,779
Dr. Robert Stadler, once a brilliant scientist,

56
00:04:42,779 --> 00:04:46,259
has sacrificed his integrity for government funding.

57
00:04:46,259 --> 00:04:50,540
He knows Reardon Medal is safe, but refuses to say so publicly.

58
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:53,339
The intellectual establishments contempt for commerce

59
00:04:53,339 --> 00:04:54,899
is parasitic.

60
00:04:54,899 --> 00:04:58,100
They depend on producers while despising them.

61
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:02,220
And the attack on Reardon Medal is part of a larger pattern.

62
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:04,459
The looters cannot compete through merit,

63
00:05:04,459 --> 00:05:07,459
so they use institutions like the State Science Institute

64
00:05:07,459 --> 00:05:09,860
to destroy what they cannot create.

65
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:12,259
In the next episode, we'll see who truly exploits

66
00:05:12,259 --> 00:05:14,899
whom is the equalization of opportunity bill passes,

67
00:05:14,899 --> 00:05:16,939
stripping Reardon of his or mines.

68
00:05:16,939 --> 00:05:19,139
The looters tighten their grip, but the producers

69
00:05:19,139 --> 00:05:20,540
prepare to fight back.

70
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:21,660
See you in the next one.
