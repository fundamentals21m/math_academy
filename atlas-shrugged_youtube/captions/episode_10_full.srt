1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,120
I am leaving it as I found it. Take over. It's yours." A pillar of fire rises from the oil fields

2
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:13,759
of Colorado. Ellis Wyatt has set fire to his own creation and vanished, leaving behind a burning

3
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:20,320
torch that will blaze for years. Rather than let the looters seize what he built, he chose to destroy

4
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:27,120
it himself. This is the end of part one, and the beginning of something no one yet understands.

5
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:31,859
Previously, Dagnian Reardon discovered something their world tries to deny,

6
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:38,020
that the mind and body are not enemies, that the man who builds railroads can also experience joy

7
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:42,500
without guilt, that achievement in business and happiness and living belong together.

8
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:49,060
The sacred and the profane are one. Welcome back to Atlas Shrugged.

9
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:55,460
In our last episode, we explored Reardon's internal conflict between the sacred and the profane.

10
00:00:56,179 --> 00:01:00,899
Today, part one concludes with a shocking image, why it's torch.

11
00:01:01,859 --> 00:01:07,140
Ellis Wyatt, the oil producer whose fields made Colorado's industrial boom possible,

12
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:10,739
sets fire to everything he built and disappears into the night.

13
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:16,819
This act of destruction, the destruction of one's own creation rather than surrender it to

14
00:01:16,819 --> 00:01:23,700
looters, becomes a symbol of the producer's rebellion. But what does it mean? And who is taking these

15
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:25,700
men?

16
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:31,719
The chapter opens with the passage of new legislation designed to strangle the booming Colorado economy.

17
00:01:31,719 --> 00:01:36,519
New directives would freeze wages and prices, preventing the market from functioning.

18
00:01:36,519 --> 00:01:40,359
Workers would be forbidden from quitting their jobs without permission.

19
00:01:40,359 --> 00:01:45,879
Businesses would be required to produce at least as much as the previous year,

20
00:01:45,879 --> 00:01:49,640
regardless of whether conditions make this possible.

21
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:52,680
And here's the most insidious provision.

22
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:57,319
New inventions and new businesses would require government permission.

23
00:01:58,599 --> 00:02:03,879
Innovation itself would be controlled. These are not regulations. They are chains.

24
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:08,120
The looters have learned nothing from the success of the John Gault line.

25
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:13,879
Instead, they've decided that if achievement is possible, it must be made illegal.

26
00:02:14,379 --> 00:02:18,139
Ellis Wyatt has told he must operate under impossible restrictions.

27
00:02:18,139 --> 00:02:23,580
His oil fields built through years of work, innovation and determination will be controlled by

28
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:27,900
bureaucrats who know nothing about oil production. He has two choices.

29
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:32,860
Comply and watch his creation be destroyed slowly by incompetent management, or

30
00:02:33,659 --> 00:02:39,979
Wyatt makes his choice. He sets fire to his own oil fields. A pillar of fire rises from Colorado,

31
00:02:39,979 --> 00:02:45,020
the wells ablaze, burning with a fury that cannot be extinguished. The note pinned to his empty

32
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:53,819
house says only, I am leaving it as I found it. Take over. It's yours. He has left them nothing but flames.

33
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:58,639
What does Wyatt's torch mean? On one level, it's an act of defiance.

34
00:02:58,639 --> 00:03:01,919
Wyatt refuses to let the looters benefit from his work.

35
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:05,400
If they want his oil, they can try to pump it from burning wells.

36
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:09,840
He has denied them the fruits of his labor. On a deeper level, it's a message.

37
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:14,879
The producers can leave. The mind can go on strike.

38
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:18,000
The men who move the world can simply stop.

39
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,199
And when they do, they will leave nothing behind for those who sought to enslave them.

40
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:28,560
But there's also a mystery. Where did Wyatt go? Who recruited him?

41
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:33,120
The question, who is John Galt, takes on new meaning?

42
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:37,759
Someone is taking these men. Someone is organizing this Exodus.

43
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:43,039
Part 1 ends with fire and with questions that will drive the rest of the novel.

44
00:03:43,539 --> 00:03:47,539
Let's recap what we learned in this climactic conclusion to part one.

45
00:03:47,539 --> 00:03:51,379
New legislation threatens to freeze the economy and ban innovation,

46
00:03:51,379 --> 00:03:53,860
making achievement itself illegal.

47
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:58,180
Ellis Wyatt destroys his own oil fields rather than surrender them to the looters,

48
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:00,500
creating why it's torch.

49
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:04,900
The Act of Destruction is an Act of Defiance,

50
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:08,500
and a message that the producers can withdraw their sanction.

51
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:11,780
And the question, who is John Galt, becomes urgent?

52
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:14,979
Someone is recruiting the vanishing producers.

53
00:04:14,979 --> 00:04:17,779
Someone is leading them somewhere.

54
00:04:17,779 --> 00:04:19,620
Part 2.

55
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:24,420
Either or will intensify the conflict between producers and looters.

56
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:29,139
We'll meet new characters, learn more about the mysterious destroyer,

57
00:04:29,139 --> 00:04:32,420
and watch as the world's contradictions reach their breaking point.

58
