1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,680
He was the kind of man who had never thought of his own existence as important enough to

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:05,440
require an explanation.

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:09,359
He worked, he loved his work, he did not ask why.

4
00:00:09,359 --> 00:00:13,800
This is the prime mover, the creative mind that drives civilization forward.

5
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:18,839
And in this chapter, we'll see both the heights such minds can reach, and the forces gathering

6
00:00:18,839 --> 00:00:19,600
to destroy them.

7
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:23,500
Previously, we saw the looters conspiracy take shape.

8
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:28,420
The anti-dog-eat-dog rule destroyed Dan Conway's Phoenix Durango Railroad,

9
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:31,420
all in the name of preventing destructive competition.

10
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:33,179
The pattern is becoming clear.

11
00:00:33,179 --> 00:00:36,939
Use the language of fairness to destroy the capable.

12
00:00:36,939 --> 00:00:41,060
Welcome back to Atlas Shrugged.

13
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:47,619
In our last episode, we exposed the looters conspiracy and the anti-dog-eat-dog rule.

14
00:00:47,619 --> 00:00:51,460
Today, we explore the concept of the prime movers.

15
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:56,219
The industrialists, inventors, and creators who drive civilization forward.

16
00:00:56,219 --> 00:00:58,619
We'll learn about Francisco Donconia's brilliant youth

17
00:00:58,619 --> 00:01:03,179
and see the devastating consequences of the anti-dog-eat-dog rule as it takes effect.

18
00:01:03,179 --> 00:01:05,379
The title, the Immovable Movers,

19
00:01:05,379 --> 00:01:10,500
alludes to Aristotle's concept of the unmoved mover.

20
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:15,219
The source of all action that is not itself moved by anything external.

21
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:18,700
The prime movers of industry are the human equivalent.

22
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:22,980
They create value without being driven by forces outside themselves.

23
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:27,719
Through Dagnese memories, we learn about Francisco Danconia's extraordinary childhood.

24
00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:32,760
The Danconia fortune was built over centuries by generations of brilliant industrialists.

25
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:38,439
Francisco was raised to be the crown jewel of the line, educated to continue and expand the

26
00:01:38,439 --> 00:01:44,840
family's legacy of achievement. Even as a child, Francisco was a prodigy. He excelled at everything,

27
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:51,239
mathematics, science, business, sports. He seemed to embody the human potential for greatness

28
00:01:51,239 --> 00:01:57,719
that the novel celebrates. Francisco spent summers with the taggarts, where he and Dagnese

29
00:01:57,719 --> 00:02:04,120
became close friends. Their friendship was based on shared values, a love of productive work,

30
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:09,080
and contempt for those who merely existed without creating. Here's a striking detail.

31
00:02:09,719 --> 00:02:15,080
As a teenager, Francisco once worked in Cognito in a Danconia copper foundry to learn the

32
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:20,520
business from the ground up. He rose to become one of the most valued workers before revealing his

33
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:29,080
identity. He was committed to earning everything, despite being born to wealth.

34
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:35,580
The anti-dog eat dog rule takes effect, and Dan Conway is forced to close the Phoenix Durango Railroad.

35
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:40,539
Conway's words capture the tragedy. I've never asked anyone to give me anything.

36
00:02:40,539 --> 00:02:44,460
I thought people got things by working for them, but it's not so simple.

37
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:48,139
I built something good, and they're taking it away from me.

38
00:02:48,139 --> 00:02:51,979
Conway represents the producer who plays by the rules and loses.

39
00:02:51,979 --> 00:02:56,219
He built a better railroad through years of hard work and superior service.

40
00:02:56,219 --> 00:02:59,500
His reward is destruction through political manipulation.

41
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:04,219
This scene illustrates what happens when the rules of the game are rigged against the competent.

42
00:03:04,219 --> 00:03:07,259
Those who cannot compete through merit turn to force,

43
00:03:07,259 --> 00:03:10,060
and the best are punished for their excellence.

44
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:15,840
With Phoenix Durango forced out of Colorado, the state's industrial economy faces disaster.

45
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:20,319
Ellis Wyatt and other producers in the region depend on reliable transportation.

46
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:22,800
Taggart Transcontinental cannot provide it.

47
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,000
The Rio Norte line is crumbling from years of neglect.

48
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,680
Here's the irony.

49
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:31,759
The Anti-Dog-Eat-Dog Rule.

50
00:03:31,759 --> 00:03:35,439
Designed to help Taggart Transcontinental by eliminating competition

51
00:03:35,439 --> 00:03:38,639
actually threatens to destroy Colorado's economy.

52
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:42,319
The Looters' victory may become their defeat as the industrial system

53
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:43,759
they feed upon collapses.

54
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:49,199
Dagnie must rebuild the Rio Norte line quickly, or lose Colorado's business entirely.

55
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:55,439
She commits to using Reardon Metal, a controversial decision that will bring her into conflict

56
00:03:55,439 --> 00:04:03,520
with both her brother and the public.

57
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:06,020
The key themes in this chapter.

58
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:08,419
First, the prime mover.

59
00:04:08,419 --> 00:04:11,060
The creative minds who drive civilization forward

60
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:13,860
are like the unmoved mover of philosophy.

61
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:15,699
They are the source of productive action,

62
00:04:15,699 --> 00:04:18,420
driving the economy through their vision and effort.

63
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:21,379
Second, the cost of looting.

64
00:04:21,379 --> 00:04:23,139
When looters destroy producers,

65
00:04:23,139 --> 00:04:26,259
they destroy the source of the wealth they seek to seize.

66
00:04:26,259 --> 00:04:29,139
You cannot consume what has not been produced.

67
00:04:29,139 --> 00:04:31,860
Third, human potential.

68
00:04:31,939 --> 00:04:35,540
Francisco's backstory illustrates the heights humans can achieve

69
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:38,259
when free to develop their abilities.

70
00:04:38,259 --> 00:04:40,019
His apparent fall from these heights

71
00:04:40,019 --> 00:04:43,060
makes his current behavior all the more mysterious.

72
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:45,860
Fourth, the race against time.

73
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:49,860
Dagnie must rebuild before the system collapses completely.

74
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:53,860
The question is whether creation can outpace destruction.

75
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,759
Let's recap what we learned today.

76
00:04:56,759 --> 00:05:00,680
The prime movers are the creative minds who drive civilization forward.

77
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:03,279
Without them, society cannot function.

78
00:05:03,279 --> 00:05:07,319
Francisco Danconea's brilliant youth is revealed through Dagnese memories,

79
00:05:07,319 --> 00:05:12,920
deepening the mystery of his current behavior as a seemingly idle playboy.

80
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:19,600
Dan Conway's defeat illustrates how the productive are punished in a society corrupted by political manipulation.

81
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:23,720
The Colorado crisis shows the consequences of destroying producers.

82
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:26,959
The looters' victory threatens the economy they feed upon.

83
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:33,319
And Dagnese commitment to rebuilding the Rio Norte line with Reardon Metal sets up the novel's central conflict.

84
00:05:33,319 --> 00:05:37,920
In the next episode, we'll witness one of the most famous scenes in literature.

85
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:40,560
Francisco Danconea's money speech.

86
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:46,279
When someone declares that money is the root of all evil, Francisco responds with a philosophical defense

87
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:50,600
that will change how you think about wealth, trade, and freedom.

88
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,279
See you in the next one.
