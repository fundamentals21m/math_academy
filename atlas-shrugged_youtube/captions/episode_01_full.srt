1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,360
Who is John Gault? A phrase of despair, a shrug of resignation, a question nobody expects to be

2
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:12,800
answered. This is the opening line of Atlas shrugged, a novel that asks what would happen if the

3
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:19,199
people who moved the world simply stopped. Welcome to the most ambitious philosophical novel ever written.

4
00:00:19,699 --> 00:00:27,539
I'm Brian, and this is Atlas Shrugged, an interactive video course exploring I'm RAN's 1957 Masterpiece.

5
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:32,420
Over the next 30 episodes, we'll work through all three parts of this epic novel.

6
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:37,380
Non-contradiction, either or, and A is A.

7
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:44,179
We'll explore the plot, analyze the characters, and wrestle with the philosophical ideas

8
00:00:44,179 --> 00:00:48,659
that have made this one of the most influential, and controversial.

9
00:00:48,659 --> 00:00:54,500
Books of the 20th century. By the end of this series, you'll understand the central mystery of

10
00:00:54,500 --> 00:01:00,979
who John Galt is, the philosophy of objectivism as RAN presents it. Why this novel continues to

11
00:01:00,979 --> 00:01:06,900
spark debate decades later, and most importantly, you'll be equipped to form your own judgment.

12
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:14,340
Each episode includes plot summaries, character analysis, key themes, and discussion questions.

13
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:20,180
The interactive course website has additional materials and quizzes, a note before we begin.

14
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:25,700
Atlas Shrugged presents a specific philosophical viewpoint. This course aims to help you

15
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:31,620
understand RAN's ideas as she presented them. Whether you agree or disagree, engaging seriously

16
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:40,659
with her arguments will sharpen your own thinking. Let's begin.

17
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:44,159
The novel opens on a dark street in New York City.

18
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:47,959
Eddie Willers, a loyal employee of Taggart Transcontinental Railroad,

19
00:01:47,959 --> 00:01:51,760
encounters a bum who asks him the question that haunts this world.

20
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:53,659
Who is John Galt?

21
00:01:53,659 --> 00:01:58,659
Eddie can't explain why this meaningless phrase fills him with such dread.

22
00:01:58,659 --> 00:02:00,459
It's become a slang expression.

23
00:02:00,459 --> 00:02:06,459
Something people say when they mean don't ask questions nobody can answer, or what's the use?

24
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:10,960
As Eddie walks through the city, Rand shows us a world in decline.

25
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:14,560
Buildings have cracks, running down their facades.

26
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,060
Gold leaf peels from spires.

27
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:20,259
Every fourth storefront is dark and empty.

28
00:02:20,259 --> 00:02:24,560
A giant calendar hangs over the city, displaying September's Seag.

29
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:28,060
Time passing, as civilization slowly crumbles.

30
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:30,860
Eddie arrives at the Taggart Transcontinental headquarters.

31
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:33,659
One of the last great railroads still functioning.

32
00:02:33,659 --> 00:02:36,060
Here we learn that the railroad is in trouble.

33
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:38,659
The Rio Norte line in Colorado is failing.

34
00:02:38,659 --> 00:02:40,560
Suppliers aren't delivering.

35
00:02:40,659 --> 00:02:41,759
Something is wrong.

36
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:43,960
Something Eddie can sense but cannot name.

37
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,560
Here's an important point.

38
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:50,259
Eddie's causeless uneasiness represents something deeper than personal anxiety.

39
00:02:50,259 --> 00:02:55,360
It's the subconscious awareness that something fundamental is wrong with the world.

40
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,360
That the foundations are crumbling even though no one will admit it.

41
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:03,900
Enter Dagnie Taggart, the vice president and charge of operations at Taggart Transcontinental.

42
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:09,500
She is the novel's protagonist, a woman who refuses to give up on the world despite its decline.

43
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:15,500
Unlike her brother James, who is the nominal president, Dagnie actually keeps the railroad running.

44
00:03:16,539 --> 00:03:22,780
James operates through political connections and evasions. Dagnie operates through

45
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:29,740
competence and determination. Consider the contrast. James speaks in abstractions about

46
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:37,979
social responsibility and the public good. Dagnie speaks in concrete terms about rail shipments,

47
00:03:37,979 --> 00:03:44,939
delivery schedules and bridge repairs. James avoids problems. Dagnie solves them.

48
00:03:46,139 --> 00:03:51,500
The chapter establishes that Dagnie has ordered new rail from Reardon's Steel. From a man named

49
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:56,860
Hank Reardon, who has invented a revolutionary new metal. This connection will prove central to

50
00:03:56,860 --> 00:04:03,020
the story. We also learn that capable people are mysteriously disappearing. Owen Kellogg,

51
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:08,780
a promising engineer, has quit without explanation. He's just one of many. The best people are leaving

52
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:16,779
and no one knows why.

53
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:20,959
Let's identify the key themes Rand introduces in this opening chapter.

54
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:23,759
First, competence versus pull.

55
00:04:24,319 --> 00:04:29,040
Dagnia achieves through ability. James operates through political connections.

56
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:33,040
This contrast between merit and manipulation runs throughout the entire novel.

57
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,920
Second, the unnamed dread.

58
00:04:37,279 --> 00:04:42,480
Eddy's causeless uneasiness represents the subconscious awareness that something fundamental is wrong.

59
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:47,920
The world is falling apart, but people either can't see it or won't admit it.

60
00:04:48,879 --> 00:04:51,439
Third, decay and decline.

61
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,879
The crumbling city infrastructure mirrors the intellectual and moral decay of society.

62
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:01,199
Buildings crack, gold leaf peels, storefronts go dark.

63
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:04,000
Physical decay reflects spiritual decay.

64
00:05:04,879 --> 00:05:06,480
Fourth, the mystery.

65
00:05:07,519 --> 00:05:11,120
Who is John Galt begins as a rhetorical expression of despair.

66
00:05:11,839 --> 00:05:16,879
But as we'll discover, it's actually the novel's central question, and it has a very concrete answer.

67
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:18,720
Here's an important point.

68
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:23,199
The central premise of Atlas shrugged is revealed gradually throughout the novel.

69
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:30,480
What if the people who move the world, the thinkers, inventors, and producers simply stopped?

70
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:32,480
What if Atlas shrugged?

71
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:38,899
Atlas shrugged is organized into three parts, each named after a principle of Aristotelian logic.

72
00:05:38,899 --> 00:05:45,860
Part 1. Non-contradiction. The world begins to crumble as capable people mysteriously disappear.

73
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:51,459
The law of non-contradiction states that something cannot be both true and false at the same time.

74
00:05:52,339 --> 00:05:56,579
This part shows a world full of contradictions that cannot be sustained.

75
00:05:57,459 --> 00:05:59,699
Part 2. Either or.

76
00:06:00,579 --> 00:06:06,579
The conflict intensifies between producers and looters. Characters must choose sides.

77
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:12,579
Either you create value or you consume it. Either you think or you evade.

78
00:06:13,379 --> 00:06:20,259
Part 3. A is A. The mystery is revealed and the philosophy of rational self-interest is presented in full.

79
00:06:20,899 --> 00:06:28,259
A is A. The law of identity. Things are what they are. Reality cannot be wished away.

80
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:34,180
At 1,168 pages in the first edition, this is an ambitious work.

81
00:06:34,899 --> 00:06:44,819
But the structure is clear and we'll take it chapter by chapter.

82
00:06:45,319 --> 00:06:48,279
Before we continue, let's meet the key players.

83
00:06:48,279 --> 00:06:52,759
Dagnye Taggart, Vice President of Operations, Taggart Transcontinental,

84
00:06:52,759 --> 00:06:57,319
a brilliant railroad executive who refuses to give up on the world despite its decline.

85
00:06:57,319 --> 00:07:01,240
Hank Reardon, industrialist, creator of Reardon Metal,

86
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:06,680
a self-made steel magnate who invents a revolutionary new alloy stronger and lighter than steel.

87
00:07:07,399 --> 00:07:12,519
John Galt, the mysterious figure, the man behind the question that haunts the world.

88
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,399
His identity and purpose form the central mystery.

89
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:22,120
Francisco Donconia, copper, air, and industrialist,

90
00:07:22,759 --> 00:07:27,720
a brilliant aristocrat who seems to have abandoned his productive genius for a life of playboy for

91
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:33,319
equality. Why? James Taggart, President, Taggart Transcontinental.

92
00:07:33,959 --> 00:07:37,720
Dagnye's brother who runs the railroad through political connections rather than competence.

93
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:41,100
Let's recap what we learned in this opening chapter.

94
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:45,019
Who is John Galt opens the novel as a phrase of despair,

95
00:07:45,019 --> 00:07:47,819
but it will become the central mystery to be solved.

96
00:07:47,819 --> 00:07:50,620
Dagnie Taggart is introduced as a competent executive

97
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:55,259
fighting to keep her railroad running in a world that punishes achievement.

98
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:59,180
The world is in decline.

99
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:02,300
Infrastructure crumbles, businesses fail,

100
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:06,139
and capable people are mysteriously disappearing.

101
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:11,420
The contrast between producers and looters is established through Dagnie versus James Taggart,

102
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:14,779
and the novel's three-part structure reflects principles of logic,

103
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:18,860
non-contradiction, either or, and A is A.

104
00:08:19,579 --> 00:08:22,459
In the next episode, we'll meet Hank Reardon,

105
00:08:22,459 --> 00:08:27,980
the steel industrialist who has spent 10 years creating a revolutionary, new, metal.

106
00:08:29,019 --> 00:08:33,100
We'll witness the first pore of Reardon Metal and see the stark contrast between a man who

107
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:38,940
creates value and those who merely consume it. Before the next episode, think about this.

108
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:45,740
Who is John Galt is used as an expression of despair in this world?

109
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:52,299
What does it tell us about a society when people adopt a meaningless phrase to express their

110
00:08:52,299 --> 00:08:56,700
hopelessness? Can you think of similar phrases in our own culture?
