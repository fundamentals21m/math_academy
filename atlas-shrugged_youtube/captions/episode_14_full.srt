1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,799
The looters cannot survive without the producers.

2
00:00:02,799 --> 00:00:05,599
They cannot create wealth, only seize it.

3
00:00:05,599 --> 00:00:08,800
They cannot run businesses, only regulate them.

4
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:12,599
They cannot invent, only ban invention.

5
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:14,599
So why do the producers submit?

6
00:00:14,599 --> 00:00:18,199
Why do the creators of value serve those who only destroy it?

7
00:00:18,199 --> 00:00:21,000
Because the victims have granted their sanction.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
And the moment they withdraw it, the system collapses.

9
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:29,620
Previously, we saw white blackmail in action, guilt as a weapon against the productive.

10
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:35,780
Are you successful? Feel guilty? Are you intelligent? Feel guilty. The looters can't match the

11
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:40,500
producers' inability so they attack through morality. They make excellence feel like sin.

12
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:48,179
Welcome back to Atlas Shrugged. In our last episode, we explored white blackmail, the use of guilt

13
00:00:48,179 --> 00:00:53,700
as a weapon against the productive. Today, we examine the deeper principle that makes such manipulation

14
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:59,939
possible, the sanction of the victim. This is perhaps the novel's most important concept.

15
00:01:00,579 --> 00:01:05,780
It explains how a minority of looters can control a majority of producers, and why that control

16
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:12,420
can be broken instantly, if the producers choose. The sanction of the victim means that exploitation

17
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:22,819
requires the victim's cooperation. No one can be enslaved without consent.

18
00:01:23,319 --> 00:01:25,319
What is the sanction of the victim?

19
00:01:25,319 --> 00:01:29,780
It's the idea that evil is powerless without the cooperation of the good.

20
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:32,760
Looters cannot function without producers to loot.

21
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:36,280
Parasites cannot survive without hosts to feed upon.

22
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:40,319
The incompetent cannot maintain civilization without the competent to run it.

23
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:41,959
The looters know this.

24
00:01:41,959 --> 00:01:45,920
That's why they work so hard to convince producers that sacrifice is noble,

25
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:49,819
that guilt is proper, that achievement is something to apologize for.

26
00:01:49,819 --> 00:01:52,560
If the producers ever stop believing these lies,

27
00:01:52,659 --> 00:01:54,159
the game is over.

28
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:58,060
Reardon grants his sanction every time he accepts guilt for his success.

29
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:01,260
Every time he lets his family drain him without protest.

30
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:05,359
Every time he obeys a regulation, he knows is unjust.

31
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:07,359
He is the looters' strength.

32
00:02:07,359 --> 00:02:10,360
Without his compliance, they have nothing.

33
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:15,560
The moment he withdraws his sanction, refuses the guilt, rejects the obligations,

34
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:18,460
stops cooperating, he is free.

35
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:19,960
And they are powerless.

36
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:23,740
The sanction of the victim has profound implications.

37
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:26,939
First, it means that the producers are not truly victims.

38
00:02:26,939 --> 00:02:28,460
They are collaborators.

39
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:31,340
They choose to accept the guilt, obey the regulations,

40
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:32,699
serve the system.

41
00:02:32,699 --> 00:02:34,300
They could choose differently.

42
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:37,979
Second, it means the looters are not truly powerful.

43
00:02:37,979 --> 00:02:41,259
They depend entirely on the producer's cooperation.

44
00:02:41,259 --> 00:02:45,419
Their laws, their guns, their threats are meaningless

45
00:02:45,419 --> 00:02:47,340
if the producers refuse to comply.

46
00:02:48,219 --> 00:02:51,740
Third, it means liberation is possible at any moment,

47
00:02:52,699 --> 00:02:56,460
not through revolution or violence, but through simple refusal.

48
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:59,580
Stop producing for those who punish production.

49
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:02,860
Stop creating for those who destroy creation.

50
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:05,419
Stop granting your sanction.

51
00:03:06,379 --> 00:03:07,500
This is the strike.

52
00:03:08,539 --> 00:03:11,419
Not a strike for higher wages or better conditions,

53
00:03:12,219 --> 00:03:15,659
but a strike against the entire system that demands sacrifice

54
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:17,340
from the able to the unable.

55
00:03:18,139 --> 00:03:25,659
The mind on strike.

56
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:29,840
The sanction of the victim is the key to understanding Atlas shrugged.

57
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,800
The looters rule only because the producers let them.

58
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:37,120
The system of sacrifice continues only because the victims cooperate.

59
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:41,280
The moment the producers withdraw their sanction, stop accepting guilt,

60
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:46,080
stop obeying unjust laws, stop serving those who despise them.

61
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,560
The entire structure collapses.

62
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,280
This is what John Galt has discovered.

63
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:54,479
This is what he offers the vanishing producers.

64
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:58,719
Not a new ideology or political system, but a simple truth.

65
00:03:58,719 --> 00:04:01,120
You don't have to cooperate in your own destruction.

66
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,120
Stop granting your sanction.

67
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:06,000
Let the looters try to run the world without you.

68
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
See you in the next episode.
