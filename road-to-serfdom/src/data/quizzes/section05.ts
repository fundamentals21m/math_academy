      'An undisputed truth',
    ],
    correctIndex: 2,

    question: 'What did the American "Temporary National Economic Committee" study conclude about monopoly?',
    options: [
      'That large-scale production efficiency always leads to monopoly',
      'That monopoly is technologically inevitable',
      'That competition cannot exist in modern industry',
      'That the view that efficiency causes monopoly "finds scant support in any evidence"',

    question: 'Hayek argues that the complexity of modern society makes central planning:',
    options: [
      'More necessary than ever',
      'Completely impossible',
      'Easier due to computers',
      'Less viable—complexity requires the price system, not central direction',
    ],

    difficulty: 'medium',
    explanation: 'Hayek turns the complexity argument on its head: it is precisely modern complexity that makes competition more necessary, since no central planner can know what millions know.',

      'They are more intelligent than others',
      'They dislike democracy',
      'They have studied planning extensively',
    ],
    correctIndex: 0,
    difficulty: 'medium',
    explanation: 'Experts favor planning because they see that their specific goals could be achieved—but they fail to see that this requires sacrificing other goals, which falls outside their specialism.',

    type: 'multiple-choice',
    question: 'What role does the price system play, according to Hayek?',
    options: [
      'It causes economic chaos',
      'It benefits only large corporations',
      'It transmits information allowing coordination without conscious central direction',
      'It should be replaced by planning boards',
    ],
    correctIndex: 2,
    difficulty: 'easy',
    explanation: 'The price system enables entrepreneurs to adjust their activities to others by watching comparatively few prices—an apparatus for transmitting information without central direction.',

    ],
    correctIndex: 1,
