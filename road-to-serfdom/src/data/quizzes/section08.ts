    options: [
      'It makes planning easier',
      'Like justice, it is no respecter of persons—outcomes don\'t depend on anyone\'s judgment of merit',

      'It prevents all inequality'
    ],
    correctIndex: 1,
    difficulty: 'medium',
    explanation: 'Blindness was an attribute of the ancient deity of justice. Competition, like justice, is "no respecter of persons"—rewards depend on capacity and luck rather than someone\'s conscious design.',

    question: 'According to Hayek, even a badly paid worker in a free society is more free than a comfortable person in a planned economy because:',
    options: [
      'Money doesn\'t matter',

      'Planned economies pay less',
      'Freedom is only about voting'
    ],
    correctIndex: 1,
    difficulty: 'medium',
    explanation: 'In a free society, no one can prevent you from attempting to improve your position. Under planning, success depends on authority\'s approval, and all changes require official permission.',

      'A translation error',
      'Democratic voting procedures'
    ],

      'People complain more'
    ],

      'Whether elections are held'
    ],
    correctIndex: 1,
    difficulty: 'medium',
    explanation: 'In a liberal system, economic forces work independently of government direction. In a totalitarian system, one power has control over all human ends and complete power over each individual\'s position.',
