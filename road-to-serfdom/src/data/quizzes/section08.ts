    options: [
      'It makes planning easier',
      'It hides economic information',
      'Like justice, it is no respecter of persons—outcomes don\\\\'t depend on anyone\\\\'s judgment of merit',
      'It prevents all inequality',
    ],
    correctIndex: 2,
    difficulty: 'medium',
    explanation: 'Blindness was an attribute of the ancient deity of justice. Competition, like justice, is "no respecter of persons"—rewards depend on capacity and luck rather than someone\'s conscious design.',

    question: 'According to Hayek, even a badly paid worker in a free society is more free than a comfortable person in a planned economy because:',
    options: [
      'In a free society there are no absolute impediments—you can change jobs, residence, views without official permission',
      'Money doesn\\\\\'t matter',
      'Freedom is only about voting',
      'Planned economies pay less',
    ],
    correctIndex: 0,
    difficulty: 'medium',
    explanation: 'In a free society, no one can prevent you from attempting to improve your position. Under planning, success depends on authority\'s approval, and all changes require official permission.',

      'A translation error',
      'Democratic voting procedures',
    ],

      'Planners are mean',
      'People complain more',
    ],
    correctIndex: 0,
    difficulty: 'medium',
    explanation: 'Inequality is more readily borne when determined by impersonal forces than when due to design. Under planning, someone must decide not just if you fit a job, but "whether you are of use for anything."',

    ],
    correctIndex: 2,
    difficulty: 'medium',
    explanation: 'In a liberal system, economic forces work independently of government direction. In a totalitarian system, one power has control over all human ends and complete power over each individual\'s position.',
