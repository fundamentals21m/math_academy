    question: 'According to Hayek, economic control is really:',
    options: [
      'Control of the means for all our ends—and thus control over which ends are served',
      'Control of a minor sector of life separate from higher values',
      'Only about money and prices',
      'Easily separated from personal freedom',
    ],
    correctIndex: 0,
    difficulty: 'easy',
    explanation: 'Economic control is not control of a separate sector but control of the means for all ends. Whoever controls the means determines which ends can be pursued.',

    question: 'Hayek describes money as:',
    options: [
      'The root of all evil',
      'Something that should be abolished',
      'One of the greatest instruments of freedom ever invented',
      'Only useful for the wealthy',
    ],
    correctIndex: 2,
    difficulty: 'easy',
    explanation: 'Money is one of the greatest instruments of freedom ever invented—it opens an astounding range of choice even to the poor, allowing trade with many rather than dependence on one.',

    question: 'Hayek argues there is no such thing as a separate "economic motive" because:',
    options: [
      'People are not interested in economics',
      'All our ends compete for the same scarce means—economic choices are choices among ultimate values',
      'Economics is too complicated',
      'Only governments have economic motives',
    ],
    correctIndex: 1,
    difficulty: 'medium',
    explanation: 'When we supposedly act from "economic motives," we actually mean our non-economic aims are limited by available means. All ends compete for scarce resources.',

    question: 'The claim that planning can control production while leaving consumption free is:',
    options: [
      'A valid middle ground',
      'Proven successful in practice',
      'The official socialist position',
      'An illusion—control of production determines what goods are available to consume',
    ],
    correctIndex: 3,
    difficulty: 'medium',
    explanation: 'Control of production inevitably means control of consumption because the planning authority determines what goods are available. "Consumer sovereignty" is precisely what planning destroys.',

    type: 'multiple-choice',
    question: 'Why does Hayek say "economic" freedoms like travel, choice of work, and leisure matter?',
    options: [
      'They don\\'t matter much compared to political freedoms',
      'They only matter to the wealthy',
      'They are often dearer to us than anything else—even free speech requires material resources',
      'They can easily be replaced by government provision',
    ],
    correctIndex: 2,
    difficulty: 'medium',
    explanation: 'So-called "economic" freedoms are often what we value most. Even free speech requires printing, paper, halls—when the state controls all material resources, no freedom is secure.',
  },

    id: 6,
    type: 'multiple-choice',
    question: 'Private property is the most important guarantee of freedom because:',
    options: [
      'It divides control among many independent actors, so nobody has complete power over us',
      'It makes everyone wealthy',
      'It was endorsed by Marx',
      'It eliminates all inequality',
    ],
    correctIndex: 0,
    difficulty: 'medium',
    explanation: 'Private property guarantees freedom—even for the propertyless—because control is divided among many independent people. If all means are in one hand, that hand has complete power.',
  },
