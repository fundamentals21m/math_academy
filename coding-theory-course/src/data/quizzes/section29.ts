    question: 'If a QR code has minimum distance $d = 5$, what is the minimum distance of its extended code (assuming $d$ is odd)?',
    correctAnswer: 6,
    numericRange: { min: 0, max: 20, precision: 0 },
    difficulty: 'medium',
    explanation: 'When extending a code with odd minimum distance $d$ by adding an overall parity check, the minimum distance increases to $d + 1$. So $d = 5$ becomes $d = 6$.',
